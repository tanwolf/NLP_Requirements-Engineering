"75137480","Use dictionaries as requirements for if statements","<p>First of all, I`m sorry if I might ask this question and if it was already answered somewhere else. I couldnt find any solution for the following Problem:</p>
<p>I want to create a list where I apply multiple restricions. But instead of using over hundreads of if statements i just want to use a dictionary in one if statement to apply the requirements. So to say I want to use the keys of the dictionary as requirements and its values as factors for the data.</p>
<p>Lets take a look at a small example:</p>
<p>I want to create data for a countourplot where x/y range from [-50,50] in steps of 1 and the z function has requirements based on the if statements:</p>
<p>The following code is what works, but the more requirements I add the longer and more unreadalbe the code gets:</p>
<pre><code>x = np.linspace(-50 , 50, 100)
y = np.linspace(-50 , 50, 100)
z = []
z_0 = 100
for i in x:
   for j in y:
      if i**2 + j**2 &lt;= 10**2:
         z.append(1.9 * z_0)
      elif i**2 + j**2 &lt;= 20**2:
         z.append(1.5 * z_0)
      elif i**2 + j**2 &lt;= 30**2:
         z.append(1.4 * z_0)

         z.append(1.05 * z_0)
      else
         z.append(z_0)
</code></pre>
<p>This would create a map with radial decreasing hight as a function of z on different positions. Is it possible to do this in the following way which is way less redundant? My main problem is how to assing the correct value.</p>
<pre><code>x = np.linspace(-50 , 50, 100)
y = np.linspace(-50 , 50, 100)

"74837919","Alloy dynamic modelling with predicates","<p>I am trying to model in alloy a system where the users can make comments on forum threads. I want to describe with a predicate a situation where a new comment is added to a forum thread.</p>
<p>This is what I have done:</p>
<pre><code>//other signatures (including User, DateTime, ...)

sig ForumThread {
    title: one String,
    datePosted: one DateTime,
    author: one User,
    content: one String,
    comments: set Comment
}

sig Comment {
    content: one String,
    datePosted: one DateTime,
    author: one User,
}

//other signatures ...

fact allCommentsAreInAThread{

    t'.author = t.author
    t'.content = t.content
    t'.title = t.title

<p>Now, this predicates is consistent (as the analyzer said). However, i think that it can be true only in trivial models, that are the ones where c is already in t.comments and where t is exactly t’. This, because the first fact says that a Comment must always have to be exactly in a ForumThread. Is what i am saying true? If yes, is there a way i can model what i am trying to do without eliminating the fact (since it wouldn't have sense to have comments that are in nothing)?</p>

<p>However, i think that it can be true only in trivial models, that are the ones where c is already in t.comments and where t is exactly t’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, because of <code>allCommentsAreInAThread</code>, which is a fact (= an axiom) so any model necessarily respects it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is there a way i can model what i am trying to do without eliminating the fact (since it wouldn't have sense to have comments that are in nothing)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You must remove the fact as, as you realized, it already imposes what you expect. Instead, you must <em>check</em> a property, which says that there's never a comment without a parent thread, in whichever <em>state</em> of your system. Hence, you need (1) a notion of state and (2) to check the property (here: an invariant) on any state.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to design a notion of state:</p>
<ol>
<li>The &quot;global state&quot; approach: you create a <code>State</code> sig (say) that gathers all state variables.</li>
<li>The &quot;local state&quot; approach: signatures contain both constant and time-varying fields.</li>
</ol>
<p>AFAIK, the latter approach is more frequent in Alloy.</p>
<p>Finally, notice Alloy 6 now has features that make it easier to model and specify state-related properties. You can find some information <a href=""https://haslab.github.io/formal-software-design/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

"73705196","How to show interaction between two statuses on a diagram?","<p>Imagine there are two statuses that an application is operating with, e.g. order status and shipment status.</p>
<p>When the order status is placed, the shipment status is blank.
When the order status is &quot;paid&quot;, the shipment status is &quot;ready to ship&quot;.
Then the shipment status is being changed to &quot;assigned&quot; through &quot;shipped&quot;, &quot;on delivery&quot; and &quot;delivered&quot;.
Should the order status be set to &quot;Cancelled&quot; the &quot;shipped&quot; or &quot;on delivery&quot; shipment status is changed to &quot;being returned&quot; and then &quot;received at the warehouse&quot;.</p>
<p>What is the best way to describe the interaction between the two statuses on a diagram?</p>
<p>I know two types of diagrams that could be utilized here, but both have drawbacks for the task:</p>
<ol>
<li>Activity Diagram - will perfectly describe the use cases, but is hard to read</li>
<li>State Machine Diagram - can only describe one status, so there can be two state diagrams, but it won't be clear how the statuses interact with each other.</li>

","<uml><analysis><diagram><requirements><system-requirements>","73731045","<p>Your UML model contains two state machines. A UML model can be visualized by one or more UML diagrams. A UML diagram may visualize any subset of the UML model, or even the whole model (see UML specification version 2.5.1, Annex A). Therefore, it is allowed to show both state machines in one diagram.</p>
<p>The dependencies between two state machines can be modeled in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using 'signal send symbols' in one state machine to send a message to the other state machine. The other state machine uses these messages by means of 'signal receipt symbols'. See figure 14.32 of UML spec 2.5.1.</p>

","<uml><use-case><requirements><use-case-diagram>","73654300","<p>I will not make a detailed review of your diagram, since this is very specific to your needs and will not help anybody else.  However,  I'd like to address some general issues that are frequent in these kind of diagrams:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It appears in the requirements that users may be a student or  faculty member (or both?), whereas your diagram suggest that a user is another independent category of actors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Having several actors for a use case is ambiguous.  It cannot always be avoided, but here, it's not clear if all the actors are involved at the same time for a search, or if they are involved one after the other, or if only one may be involved at a time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your diagram is a functional decomposition of the requirements.  For example, <code>Register</code> and <code>Verify registry</code> are not independent,  but the second belongs to the detailed decomposition of the first, without being an independent user goal (in fact, the verification doesn't make sense without the first). The same applies to all the verifications (&quot;maximum...&quot;) as well.   This is not forbidden but strongly discouraged as it leads to too detailed and complex diagrams.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sometimes your diagram seems to be a sequence of action:  e.g. <code>Return a book</code> is followed by a <code>confirmation email</code>.  Use-case diagrams shall not show any sequence.  If you want to show the workflow, you need to use an activity diagram and not a use-case diagram.</p>
</li>
<li><p>extend corresponds to an optional use-case. Here, you seem to say that books are returned only for some loans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion,  simplify your diagram to show only user goals.  Avoid extend and include dependencies as much as possible, to keep it simple and understandable.  If you want to document details, document them in a narrative, not in the diagram.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the age of Corona, we order many things online. The delivery does not
always work out as planned, so we are interested in getting (more) information
about the delivery.<br />
<br />
The DHL packet service has a comprehensive web service where it
provides information on shipping and receiving packages. Among
other things, page visitors can search for contact information on
the DHL webservice. Another option is to contact DHL via a chat.
Requests in the chat are answered automatically by a DHL AI, one
instance of the DHL webservice. A visitor can send a request (via
the chat), which includes also entering the consignment number of
the package to the DHL AI. Then, in order to get information about
the shipment, the visitor needs to authenticate in the webservice,
which promotes the visitor to a customer and the DHL AI is allowed
to reply to the chat request. In case the DHL AI cannot answer the
request, it forwards the request to a DHL employee. To shorten the
waiting time the customer can optionally contact the DHL employee
via phone.</p>

","<uml><use-case><requirements><use-case-diagram>","73297684","<p>A use case normally should correspond to a user goal, and unless it's an extension, it should also make sense independently of other use-cases. In this regard:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Reply to request</code>  does not make any sense on its own.  So this &quot;use case&quot; is probably a detail of the use-case <code>Contact DHL</code>.  The DHL AI would then be a secondary actor of the <code>Contact DHL</code> use-case.</li>
<li><code>Send request</code> seems likewise to be a detail of how to contact the DHL agent.</li>
<li>Details such as <code>Enter consignment number</code> or <code>send request</code> are user interface detail.  Use-case should not be used to model user-interface. This is a design topic, and putting it in the use-case would force to use one specific user-interface approach without considering better alternatives.</li>
<li>Authenticate is not a use-case.  It's a constraint.  Imagine that you have a system with Single Sign On (SSO):  an authentication use case would then make no sense since there is no interaction with an actor to achieve it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So keep the use-case as simple as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you start to think about the details of the scenario, and successive steps, you're no longer modeling a use-case, but a control flow:  use an activity diagram fro this level of detail.</li>
<li>if you start to take a use-case and then decompose it into smaller cases based on the narrative,  there are big chances that you'll be mislead to do functional decomposition.  This is not recommended for use-cases, since it leads to very detailed diagrams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to the optional use-case: optional typically suggest to use an extension.  But does <code>Contact by phone</code> really extend the <code>Contact via chat</code>?  I believe these two forms of contact are two different things.  I therefore see two approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just make a use-case <code>Contact DHL</code>  and in the description of this use-case you explain that the contact can be via Phone or via Chat. This is my favourite approach.</li>
<li>Make a use-case <code>Contact DHL</code> for the general case.  Make to specialisations <code>Contact DHL by chat</code> and <code>Contact DHL by phone</code> that each could implement the general case as best fits.  This approach is more complicated, but it allows to take into account more fundamental differences between the specialisations, such as the fact that an AI actor is involved in the chat and a human operator is involved on the phone.</li>

","<uml><software-design><use-case><requirements><use-case-diagram>","73255771","<h2>What is an actor?</h2>
<p>The key is to define precisely the system under consideration (called the <em><strong>subject</strong></em> in UML-speak), since this determines what is or is not an actor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each UseCase specifies some behavior that a <em><strong>subject</strong></em> can perform <em><strong>in collaboration with</strong></em> one or more <strong>Actors</strong>.<br />
(...) An <strong>Actor</strong> models a type of role played by an entity that <em><strong>interacts with the subjects</strong></em> of its associated UseCases (e.g., by exchanging signals and data). Actors may represent roles played by human users, external hardware, or other systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more general requirement analysis concept is the <em><strong>stakeholder</strong></em>.  All the actors are stakeholders, but there may be stakeholders that are not be actors, for example, if they benefit from a system indirectly.</p>
<h2>Is the dog an actor?</h2>
<p>It depends on the system under consideration.  The main cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The system is an <strong>app only used by the veterinary</strong>: the dog is <strong>not an actor</strong>.  The system supports the veterinary to achieve his/her goals.  There is no direct interaction between the dog and the system (except by accident, if he jumps on the keyboard). The dog nevertheless benefits indirectly from the system, so you may consider it as a stakeholder (should not be represented on the diagram)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The system is composed of a veterinary <strong>app and equipment that exchanges signals with the dog</strong> (e.g. microphone for AI barking analysis, camera, cardiovascular monitoring electrodes, echographic scanner...). The dog is an actor, even if the dog is passive in the interaction and does not realise that there is a computer involved. The dog is a <strong>secondary actor</strong> because the use-case supports primarily the goals of the veterinary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The system is the <strong>veterinary clinic</strong>:  You are then making a <strong>business analysis</strong>.  The dog owner would be a primary actor, since he/she interacts with the clinic for achieving his/her goals, i.e. keeping his/her best companion in good health.  The dog would be a secondary actor since it would also interact with the clinic for the use-cases of the owner (wilfully or not). But in such an analysis, the veterinary would be part of the system under consideration and not an actor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In view of the wording of your question, you're most probably in the first case.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there any procedure that can transform such files into files that are pip compatible?</li>

","<pip><conda><requirements>","73252349","<p><strong>No and no.</strong> The relation between a Conda package name to the PyPI package name is effectively arbitrary since there are no formal rules for mapping them. Sometimes they are equal; sometimes they involve prefixes/suffixes like <code>py</code> or <code>python</code>, with and without hyphens. Further, many Conda packages are not Python packages. A trivial example is <code>python</code> itself. Since there is nothing in the metadata of the packages to indicate the PyPI equivalent (if any), it is impossible to determine this without an actual brute force iteration over all the packages to extract this mapping. Perhaps someone might generate such a database someday, but for now I am unaware of its existence.</p>
<p>If you must have a pip requirements file, then export that from the environment, as in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/50777849/570918"">this thread</a>.

I installed the packages for which the stated version could not be found by hand with <code>pip install ..</code>. The installation worked fine, but when running my code afterwards I got many error messages that modules are not found or that there are problems within the modules.</p>

<p>If I am not mistaken, isn't the problem that <code>pipreqs</code> says I need <code>4.21.1</code> but the software requires it to be between <code>4.0.0</code> and <code>3.15.0</code>? Obviously, that is an invalid condition.</p>
<p>How can I get <code>pipreqs</code> to require the correction version such as <code>3.20.1</code>?</p>
","<python><python-3.x><protocol-buffers><requirements>","72452878","<p>It appears the package version condition is not possible.</p>
<p>The conditions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.15.0 &lt; Version &lt; 4.0.0 (from <code>Gmail API</code>)</li>
<li>Version == 4.21.1 (from <code>pipreqs</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not certain why <code>pipreqs</code> is generating a <code>requirements.in</code> file that says <code>protobuf==4.21.1</code> when the <code>Gmail API</code> requires something between 3.15.0 and 4.0.0.</p>
<p>I ended up manually replacing the <code>protobuf==4.21.1</code> in the <code>requirements.in</code> file, and separated the <code>pipreqs</code> and <code>pip-compile</code> commands so that I could modify the intermediate <code>requirements.in</code> file before being passed into <code>pip-compile</code>, which is where the error was occurring.</p>

"72405577","How to generate ""global documentation"" with doxygen","<p>I have a fair understanding of both how to document code and how to write &quot;generic documentation&quot; using <code>@mainpage</code>, <code>@page</code>, <code>@subpage</code> and related tags.</p>
<p>I would need to include requirements/specification documentation for the code.</p>
<p>My problem is to keep this kind of documentation (conceptually distinct from code documentation) close to code implementing functionality (i.e.: at least in the same file, sometimes even near specific classes/functions/methods) but still be able to collect it in an orderly fashion and present it in the <code>@mainpage</code>, outside file/class hierarchy.</p>
<p>What I would ideally need is to be able to place specific <code>@page</code>, <code>@section</code>, <code>@subsection</code> etc. randomly in the various source files and then be able to <code>@include</code> them in a specific order into <code>@mainpage</code> or some other <code>@subpage</code>.</p>
<p>Even better would be to be able to include the <em>same</em> snippet in both class/function full doc (not <code>@brief</code>, of course) and in the &quot;front matter&quot; linked in <code>@mainpage</code>.</p>
<p>Global effect I need to have is to have a &quot;specification document&quot; where I detail what the various parts of the code need to implement and then the &quot;normal class/function/whatever&quot; documentation doxygen id very good at providing.</p>
<p>The catch (i.e.: what I don't know how to do) is I would like to keep &quot;specification&quot; and implementation together in the source, but separate them in documentation, i.e.:</p>
<ol>
<li>General Description: easy, this goes into <code>@mainpage</code></li>
<li>Requirements: most likely at top of source file implementing them, how do I link/include in main page?</li>
<li>Specification: either right after Requirements at top of file or somewhere near class/function implementing it; also here I don't know how to link/include in &quot;front matter&quot; AKA: <code>@mainpage</code>.</li>
<li>Normal code documentation: here only thing I don't know is how include in class/function description the same &quot;doc snippet&quot; already used for (2) and (3).</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>If so, what's the best practice?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I could get the effect using a separate file for each &quot;doc snippet&quot; and then <code>@include</code>ing it in the right places, but that would defeat the whole purpose that's keep Requirements/Specification/code together while separating them in different sections in the resulting documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: following @albert comment I tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>in a standard Doxygen comment I added markers:</li>
</ul>

...

<li>in the &quot;front matter&quot; definition I have (among other things):</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>/**
@page __init Initialization
@snippet{doc} CommandHandler.c AM_init

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The function documentation is rendered correctly (i.e.: the markers are removed)</li>
<li>OTOH the initialization page is &quot;somewhat incomplete&quot;:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
Initialization

    It needs to do a long series of tests to ensure AM can actually work.
</code></pre>
<p>that's it.</p>
<p>Apparently the tag <em>is</em> found, but only the first line is actually included.</p>
<p><strong>Further Update</strong>: Following @albert answer (accepted) I had success, but the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Included snippet (<code>[AM_init]</code>) <em>must</em> be in a standard comment, not a doxygen one, otherwise snippet ends up included twice.</li>
<li>Included snippet <em>must not</em> have leading <code>*</code> (very common in &quot;standard comments&quot;.</li>
<li>Included comments <em>should</em> have HTML controls (e.g.: <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> for line termination) because Markdown constructs (&quot;double newline&quot;, in the above case) are <strong>not</strong>recognized.</li>
</ul>
<p>In retrospect I think &quot;Note&quot; in Doxygen <code>\snippet['{'option'}'] &lt;file-name&gt; ( block_id )</code> documentation addresses, more or less all the above, but I find it very cryptic and I would never have understood the implications without my nose being rubbed into them.</p>
<p>The last one is very annoying because I use a lot Lists and Tables and while HTML syntax is much more powerful, it is also much more difficult to write and to read in sources.</p>

We cannot invent stories for your users: normally, you should discuss this with your users.  But if you're learning and it could help, here an hypothetical example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>As a</strong> <em>project manager</em> <strong>I can</strong> <em>drag a project icon in the &quot;new project&quot; column across my kanban board and drop it on the &quot;in progress&quot; column</em>, <strong>so that</strong> <em>I can easily and intuitively communicate that a project was started and is still going on.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be aware that referring explicitly to a drag and drop seems very detailed and might not leave much room to propose better solutions. In this regard, you need to keep in mind that a story is not a detailed specification.  It's just <a href=""https://www.agilealliance.org/user-story-conversations/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a placeholder for a conversation</a>.  Personally, I'd rather go for something simpler like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>As a</strong> <em>project manager</em> <strong>I can</strong> <em>easily chose a project to launch and show that it is currently in-progress</em>, <strong>so that</strong> <em>the other users know on which project they may work.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would then discuss with the user about the details of the story.  Maybe drag and drop is the way to go. Maybe keyboard control (tab to select, space to chose target) is needed for <strong><a href=""https://www.w3.org/blog/wai-components-gallery/widget/accessible-drag-and-drop/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">accessibility reasons</a></strong>.  But perhaps I'll discover that some users prefer to update the status in the project card if it's on the screen.</p>
<p>Anyhow, during this conversation <a href=""https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">you'd write down all the expectations, positive and negative, for the acceptance criteria</a>.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragging from &quot;new&quot; and dropping on &quot;new&quot; cancels the drag&amp;drop operation</li>
<li>When dragging from &quot;new&quot; a visual feedback should be given to show the project moving</li>
<li>During the dragging,  the use of the escape button may cancel the operation.</li>
<li>When the project is dropped by accident,  the user may undo the operation.</li>
<li>When the project is successfully dropped on the &quot;in progress&quot; column,  any open view of the project card should be immediately opened to show the new status of the project.</li>
<li>Attempting to drag a project, of which the user is not responsible, should lead to an error message about missing authorisations, etc.. .</li>

","<uml><diagram><use-case><requirements><use-case-diagram>","70694712","<p>There are a couple of ways how to model that. The first step is always to read and understand the requirements. So putting them in some sort of order is vital. There are dedicated tools to deal with that and they may or may not be helpful (I'm talking of DOORS and the like). A more simple way is to create a profile for requirements management in UML that contains requirements elements where you can reference the customer documents and already put them in a certain structure.</p>
<p>Now in the next step you <em>synthesize</em> these requirements to use cases. That is you pinpoint the added values and make them visible. Actors and UCs shall be clearly visible.</p>
<p>Once you have done that you relate UC and requirement elements with realize relations (or some other stereotyped dependency depending on the profile you use). This way you have a nice traceability that connects requirements and UC for the upcoming design steps.</p>
<p>A more simple approach would be to just attach constraints to an elaborated UC model containing requirement text. That could be done for simple (school) projects. Though it's unlikely you find that in the industry. Either you go to war (see above) or you have just a little chit-chat with some insults.</p>

<p>A use case represents a set of behaviors offered by a system,  with observable result, that is if value for actors or other stakeholders. You need to make sure that your chose requirements meet these criteria;  not all requirements are suitable for a use case diagram.</p>

<li>Your example: <em><strong>promote the pizza shop</strong></em> is a popular business goal. It is however unclear if this is a side effect (or wishful thinking) or if the system actively promotes the shop, and who could be the primary actor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, a use-case involves actors. You need to identify those. And you should consider rewording the use-case from the perspective of the primary actor.</p>
<ul>
<li>In your example, is it really the system that <em><strong>ensure a timely delivery</strong></em>?

","<uml><use-case><requirements><scenarios><use-case-diagram>","70345542","<p>Whether you associate two distinct lecturers to the use-case or one lecturer with a multiplicity of 2 does not make a difference here.  The UML specifications let the case with multiple actors completely unspecified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>UML 2.5.1, page 640</strong></em> (highlighting is mine): <br><br>When a UseCase has an association to an Actor with a multiplicity that is greater than one at the Actor end, it means that more than one Actor instance is involved in the UseCase. <strong>The manner in which multiple Actors participate in the UseCase depends on the specific situation on hand and is not defined in this specification</strong>. For instance, a particular UseCase might require simultaneous (concurrent) action by two separate Actors (e.g., in launching a nuclear missile) or it might require complementary and successive actions by the Actors (e.g., one Actor starting something and the other one stopping it).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here some possible solutions to refine your model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show an <code>{xor}</code> constraint between the two lecturer associations.</li>
<li>Add a comment box anchored to the use case in which you explain it in plain-text.</li>
<li>Laeve the diagram as is and describe the requirement in the textual use-case description.</li>

<ul>
<li>If the number of students has no upper bound, use <code>*</code> instead of <code>M</code>.  Use a number if its specified in the text.</li>

<p>Any constraints about concurrent access are best kept in requirements, constraints and finally in the flow of events describing the many scenarios that come up.

<p>Gitlab-CI with docker executor starts with a fresh environment. You have to repeat <em>all</em> installation steps that you did on your workstation <em>inside</em> the docker environment.

","<python><git><gitlab><virtualenv><requirements>","70335164","<p>I think you mixed up some things. GitLab uses Git for version control of your files (your code). Therefore your repository should contain the files with your code. You can just put the files of your folder &quot;MyProject&quot; into the folder, where you cloned the repository to. Also add the requirements.txt the readme-file and so on.</p>
<p>The virtual environment is used to keep your system installation of Python clean and only have the necessary packages installed for each project. Among other things to avoid package requirement conflicts. The usage of an requirements.txt file is independet of the virtual environment, even if it is a sensible combination.</p>
<p>In general this means, your requirements.txt is always shared together with your code, because it lays within the same repository. When someone clones the repository, he can use the requirements.txt to install all the dependencies to his venv (or somewherer else) and then run your code without the nedd to install further python packages.</p>
<p>Your requirements.txt file has to contain columns, which look like this: <code>numpy==1.21.4</code>. Then you have to activate the environment with <code>&lt;your path to the venv folder&gt;\venv\Scripts\activate</code> and use <code>python -m pip install -r requirements.txt</code> to install the packages listed in your requirements.txt.</p>

"70084248","Exporting C# Applications to clients - Confusion about imports","<p>I never really understood the technical requirements for C# applications.
I know Windows 10 has some .NET-versions installed by default. But whenever i write a console-application in c# and copy the compiled .exe-file to another computer, the .exe-file never runs (doesnt matter if compiled with net-core or net-framework). It is always missing a lot of dependencies. So I always either have to copy a huge amount of dll-files into the same folder as the .exe-file or publish it as a standalone-application, which is ridicilous huge (130 MB .exe-file for 100-line application which does nothing special at all).</p>
<p>On the other hand i can create a windows-service, compile it and use it. The compiled service-exe is very small (around 30 kb) and can be installed via cmd.exe (&quot;sc create  [...]&quot;). I tested this on a windows 10 VM. It runs without problems.</p>
<p>Am I getting everything right? Why can windows-services run without the .dll-files, but console-applications can not? Since Windows 10 has a lot of .net-applications installed, i would assume every c# application should run on windows 10 without having to add the .dll-files.</p>
","<c#><.net><requirements>","70084434","<p>If the target computer doesn't have the .Net runtime you are targeting installed, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the runtime, then run the app.</li>
<li>Bundle the runtime with the app, either as separate files or all within the same exe.</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 2 is only available for .Net Core and .Net 5 and higher. For .Net Framework (4 and lower) you must choose option 1.</p>

","<php><routes><conditional-statements><symfony4><requirements>","69890600","<p>The order of your controller functions matter, you should put <code>/login</code> and <code>/register</code> before your <code>subpage</code> function.</p>
<p>However, sometimes it might not be possible due to other functions being in different controllers files with different names etc making ordering difficult..</p>
<p>You can use <a href=""https://regex101.com/r/ePR75X/1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Regex</em></a> in the requirements. So in your case you could do this:</p>
<pre><code>@Route(&quot;/{page}&quot;, name=&quot;subpages&quot;, requirements={&quot;page&quot;=&quot;^(?!\blogin\b|\bregister\b).+&quot;})
</code></pre>
<p>This will match any route except <code>login</code> or <code>register</code>. You can add more into the regex with a word boundary, eg <code>\bcontact\b</code>.</p>
<p>This might not be the best approach if you have lots of routes however as it can be hard to keep track. Instead you could also consider having the route like <code>&quot;/pages/{page}&quot;</code></p>
<p><strong>Symfony 5.1</strong> supports <a href=""https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-5-1-route-annotations-priority"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">priority</a> which makes this situation easier to deal with using the <code>priority</code> parameter in the annotation.</p>

"69871330","Should functions that depend upon specific values be made unsafe?","<p>I have a function that takes a <code>usize</code> equivalent to a pointer, and aligns it up to the next alignment point.</p>
<p>It doesn't require any unsafe as it's side effect free, but the alignment must be a power of two with this implementation. This means that if you use the function with bad parameters, you might get undefined behaviour later down the line. I can't check for this inside the function itself with <code>assert!</code> as it's supposed to be very fast.</p>
<pre class=""lang-rust prettyprint-override""><code>/// Align the given address `addr` upwards to alignment `align`.
///
/// Unsafe as `align` must be a power of two.
unsafe fn align_next_unsafe(addr: usize, align: usize) -&gt; usize {
    (addr + align - 1) &amp; !(align - 1)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, I've made this unsafe for the above reasons, but I'm not sure if that's best practice. Should I only define a function as unsafe if it has side effects? Or is this a valid time to require an unsafe block?</p>
","<rust><parameters><unsafe><requirements>","69873276","<p>I'll preface this by saying this is a fairly opinion-heavy answer, and represents a point of view, rather than &quot;the truth&quot;.</p>
<p>Consider this code taken from the <code>Vec</code> docs:</p>
<pre class=""lang-rust prettyprint-override""><code>let x = vec![1, 2, 4];
let x_ptr = x.as_ptr();

unsafe {
    for i in 0..x.len() {
        assert_eq!(*x_ptr.add(i), 1 &lt;&lt; i);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The function you're describing seems to have a similar safety profile to <code>Vec::as_ptr</code>. <code>Vec::as_ptr</code> is not <code>unsafe</code>, and does nothing particularly bad on its own; having an invalid <code>*const T</code> isn't bad until you dereference it. That's why dereferencing the raw pointer requires <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, I'd argue that <code>align_next</code> doesn't do anything particularly bad unless that value is then passed into some <code>unsafe</code> context. As with any question of <code>unsafe</code>, it's a tradeoff between safety/risk and ergonomics.</p>
<p>In <code>Vec::as_ptr</code>'s case, the risk is relatively low; the stdlib has lots of eyes on it, and is well &quot;battle-tested&quot;. Moreover, it is a single function with a single implementation.</p>
<p>If your <code>align_next</code> was a function on a trait, I'd be much more tempted to make it unsafe, since someone in the future could implement it badly, and you might have other code whose safety relies on a correct implementation of <code>align_next</code>.</p>
<p>However, in your case, I'd say the pattern is similar to <code>Vec::as_ptr</code>, and you should make sure that any functions that consume this value are marked <code>unsafe</code> if they can cause UB.</p>
<p>I'd also second Martin Gallagher's point about creating a <code>Result</code> returning variant and benchmarking (you could also try an <code>Option&lt;usize&gt;</code>-returning API to make use of null-pointer optimizations).</p>

<p>As you can see the boto3 and typer runtime dependencies are not optional, so I'd expect to see them in <code>poetry show geostore</code>.</p>
","<python-packaging><requirements><python-poetry>","69833825","<p>This appears to be a bug in Poetry. Or at least it's not clear from the documentation what the expected behavior would be in a case such as yours.</p>
<p>In your <code>pyproject.toml</code>, you specify two dependencies as required in this section:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.poetry.dependencies]
…
awscli = {version = &quot;*&quot;, optional = true}
boto3 = &quot;*&quot;
…
typer = &quot;*&quot;
…
</code></pre>
<p>So, as opposed to <code>awscli</code> among many others, <code>boto3</code> and <code>typer</code> should be required because the <code>optional</code> attribute is not set and defaults to <code>false</code>. But you also list the two required dependencies as &quot;extras&quot; in this section:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.poetry.extras]
…
cli = [
    &quot;boto3&quot;,
    &quot;typer&quot;,
]
…
</code></pre>
<p>Poetry takes that to mean that they are in fact optional, not required. Which makes sense, in a way, because extras are effectively optional. If you inspect the <code>.whl</code> wheel file built by Poetry (it's just a zip archive), specifically the <code>METADATA</code> file in it (which is what Pip refers to when installing the package), then it contains this line:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>Requires-Dist: typer; extra == &quot;cli&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>So that dependency is in fact optional: It will only get installed if users ask for it explicitly with <code>pip install geostore[cli]</code>.</p>
<p>The solution then is simple: Remove all references to the required dependencies from the <code>extras</code> section. They are not needed there anyway.</p>
<p>The Poetry documentation is in fact not very clear on what <code>optional</code> really signifies. That attribute is (currently) only briefly mentioned in the <a href=""https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#extras"" rel=""noreferrer"">section on the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file</a>. One could also argue that if <code>optional</code> is <code>false</code>, then the <code>extras</code> section should not override that value.</p>

of forms and pages with excel like tables full of buttons,links,form+input, etc
in each row of the tables.</p>
<p>It uses a <code>onclick=&quot;...&quot;</code> javascript for conditional button behaviors
that do input validation on the form inputs, and other such, alert()s, etc.
I used css / class attribute only for formatting, but lots of <code>id=&quot;xxx&quot;</code>
and <code>getElementById(&quot;xxx&quot;)</code> in the javascript and update the DOM from .js
functions.  I did not user any javascript frameworks like Node.js or jquery.
I did use iFrames for printout frames.</p>
<p>I also have a few cases of Select menu B options map is dependent on a
Select Menu A choice, which causes dynamic replacement of the menu B options map.
The app has more than 150 unique pages, 5 user roles. The app works in Firefox,
Safari and IE11/Edge, Chrome.</p>
<p>Q: Can TestCafe test a WebApp implemented in this outdated manner?</p>
<p>Q: Can it handle the dynamic DOM modification made via javascript functions
invoked by <code>onclick=&quot; func()&quot; and onselect=&quot; func()&quot;</code> of button and select tags?</p>
<p>Q Can TestCafe <code>Selector()</code> use element ids to <code>find()</code> elements?
as the web app generates unique ids for link, button, input, etc, tags
in rows of the tables via freemarker template variables.</p>

"68781332","Microservice design: change on data requirements or schema","<p>Suppose we have 2 services, service A and service B. They are interact with each other with event sourcing. Service A publish event ( entity1 created with fields f1, f2, f3). Service B make own copy of entity1 with fields f1 and f2. Now how we can address this two scenario.</p>
<ol>
<li>New requirement in service 2 and needs for f3. How service2 must update its local data?</li>
<li>Schema change on service 1. how service 2 must update its local data and schema?</li>
</ol>
<p>In scenario 2, services are tightly coupled by schema and can causes errors and this has contradict with event sourcing goal. How can we address this problem?</p>
","<design-patterns><microservices><event-sourcing>","68783220","<p>For scenario 1, where the view of the entity changes to incorporate fields which were published to the event stream, the easiest thing is likely to be replaying the events (e.g. if the event stream is on Kafka, using a new consumer group with <code>auto.offset.reset=earliest</code>) with an event handler which uses the new field.  This can often be surprisingly quick, allowing you to run this rebuild in a time window where the previous version of the service is running; otherwise, you should be able to run the old instance of service B alongside the new instance (if they're writing to different DBs): when the new instance catches up, you shift whatever traffic is hitting service B to use the new instance and tear down the old (basically a blue-green deploy).</p>
<p>For the second scenario, there are some choices to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can define an <code>Entity1CreatedV2</code> event which fits the new schema (this is likely to require updating consumers to know about the new event first)</li>
<li>If the fields in the old schema are unchanged (i.e. the schema change is strictly additive), you can keep the old <code>Entity1Created</code> message and then have an event for the new fields.  Note that accomodating the schema change for existing entities in service A may drive you to this solution anyway, especially if there's no command-sourcing for service A going on (command-sourcing might allow you to pretend that the new schema was around forever).</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This mostly devolves into a discussion about how much you can get away with before the words &quot;not fully&quot; aren't appropriate anymore. If you want to take things very literally, you could just have a sign bit (that conforms to IEEE 754) and nothing else (no exponent, no significant) and still say &quot;not fully compliant&quot; and be technically correct; but in this case most people would complain that the amount of &quot;not fully compliant&quot; is so close to &quot;not compliant&quot; that it's misleading.</p>
<p>To avoid being misleading; &quot;not fully compliant&quot; is closer to &quot;compliant enough for most things in practice&quot;, but this really depends on the implementation and should be interpreted as such (e.g. probably should be taken to mean &quot;read the compiler's manual&quot;).</p>
<p>Note that often &quot;not fully compliant&quot; actually means it pretends that subnormals are zero, and/or that signaling NaNs aren't supported, and/or that precision is higher than it should be (e.g. 80-bit floating point used for intermediate results causing more accurate final results than you would get if it was fully compliant).</p>
<p>Also; often compilers will offer a third &quot;fast math&quot; option that is even faster (and even less compliant), and don't use the words &quot;not fully compliant&quot; for this case. When that happens it makes sense for &quot;not fully compliant&quot; to be more of a middle ground between &quot;fast math&quot; and &quot;fully compliant&quot;.</p>

"64890268","Waterfall model","<p>Im thinking about using the waterfall model as my main development methodology for my CS exam. I have experience working with Unified Process, and agile methodolgies such as SCRUM and XP. All of these have clear and structured way to collect either tasks, use cases or user stories. But i cant seem to find the equvilent for the waterfall model.</p>
<p>So my question is, does the waterfall model have any specific way to collect your 'use cases/user stories (or whatever you may call them) - or should i borrow some from ex. UP, and work with use cases?</p>
","<task><project-management><use-case><requirements><waterfall>","65100314","<p>Waterfall, Unified Process and agile approaches differ in the way the activities are organised:</p>
<ul>
<li>all of them need somehow to cover the full spectrum of software development activities such as to gather requirements,  design the system,  implement its features and test the result and deliver it.</li>
<li>each of them package and combine these activities differently: agile for example favors small iterations that combine all these activities to deliver a software increment, until everything's done.  At the other extreme, waterfall separates these activities one after the other, with a delivery in the end and iteration (back to implementation or back to requirements) only if there's a significant problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>When carrying out these activities, you may use a set of practices that help you to achieve more effectively the result.  Practice sometimes emerge in the context of a method,  but can often be generalized to be used in other contexts.  For example:</p>
<p>In a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Waterfall</a> context, requirements are written up-front. This works well only if the requirements are very well known and do not change very often.  In the case of a study project, you may well be in such a situation.</p>
<p>Nowadays, this kind of requirements are documented using the IEEE standard of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Software Requirement Statements (SRS)</a>. Frequently, the functional part of this document is structured according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">use-cases</a> (not necessarily use-case diagrams).  Moreover modern use-cases, the so-called <a href=""https://www.ivarjacobson.com/publications/white-papers/use-case-ebook"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Use-case 2.0</a>, evolved into a more agile practice which allow to gather &quot;user-stories&quot; (user narratives) to make use-case slices that gradually enrich a use-case.  This approach is in fact very similar to user-story mapping (which defines a high level narrative line) that decomposes a narrative line into detailed user-stories.</p>
<p>So yes,  you can borrow any of those techniques, except that waterfall requires everything to be ready upfront.  Since use-cases can be used both in waterfall (traditional use-cases) or agile (use-case 2.0), it's certainly a good base in your context.  For a school work,  an SRS structured according to use-cases would certainly make good impression.  However, if you want a task oriented approach, and if all the requirements are not yet clear, I'd really advise to go for use-case 2.0 or user-story mapping, and avoid waterfall.</p>

<p>I have written a javascript function to check the length with you select Pasaporte/Cedula.</p>
<p>Secondly, in <code>&lt;input type = &quot;number&quot;/&gt;</code> you cannot set maxLength. Hence you have to set <code>&lt;input type = &quot;text&quot; /&gt;</code>. Also, an <code>onKeyPress</code> event to verify the input as number</p>

"63228853","UML: How to reduce use cases for user accounts system to avoid redundancy and unnecessary use cases?","<p>I need help to reduce the use cases on my subsystem.</p>
<p>This subsystem is about manage multiple accounts for users, administrators and a superuser with the following requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The system shall manage users accounts, where there are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Users: can create, read, update, delete and block their own accounts, also login.</p>
<p>Create needs email authentication. Login should ask for 2-step auth (optional)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Admins: can manage all users accounts (CRUD, block and login) as a user. Also read only and login their own account.</p>
<p>Login needs 2 step authentication.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Superuser: can manage both users and admin accounts (CRUD, block, logins) and their own superuser account.</p>
<p>Create admin needs email &amp; phone auth.<br>
Login is same as admins, needs 2 step auth.<br>
Can delegate the superuser access to another admin.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The system's flow need to be clear just with use case diagram and use case descriptions (without other type of diagram)</p>
<p><strong>What is the right way to design these use cases to avoid redundacy on use case descriptions and make unnecessary use cases on diagram?</strong></p>
<p>For example, on this system, the user, admin, and superuser have a Login Use Case each one. User Login ask for 2 step auth (optional) while on admin and superuser the 2 step auth must be always required.</p>
<p>SuperUser inherits from Admin who inherits from User.</p>
<p><em>The final goal I am looking for is to make (for instance) these 3 login uses cases into one that connects to the User Actor only so Admin and SuperUser inherit the use case but, due to the behavior is different for every Actor, I want to put one Login Use Case Description which changes the behavior according to the Actor type who triggers the Login. So instead of have 3 Login Use Cases (one for each actor), I have just 1 use case and 1 description that works for all.</em></p>
","<uml><software-design><use-case><requirements><use-case-diagram>","63237966","<p>What you seem to look for is the parametrised use-cases, which is a concept promoted by Alistair Cockburn for textual use-cases.</p>
<p>The typical example is CRUD when the same use-case description is used over and over again with a slight variant for each operation. The approach is the to have a parametrised use case where the parameter is the operation (create, read, update, delete).</p>
<p>The same concept doesn’t exist in UML notation as far as I know. So you would typically have either a use case <code>Manage XYZ</code> and describe the details in the narratives, or the four use-cases <code>Create XYZ</code>, <code>Update XYZ</code>, <code>Delete XYZ</code>, <code>Read XYZ</code>. Personally I prefer the first, so that the use-case convey the big picture.</p>
<p>Instead of multiplying the same use-cases for the different actors, you could also use less use-cases and use <a href=""https://www.uml-diagrams.org/constraint.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">contraints</a> to explain in plain text the special rules that apply to the  different categories of actors for the different use-cases.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to add that use-cases are not meant to model flows and sequence of events. Use cases are meant to identify different goals  that would translate to different kind of interactions. In this regard I  wonder if it could  make sense to distinguish <code>Manage own account</code> and <code>Manage other user account</code> since this correspond to very different goals.</p>

"62988451","What would be the better unit to draw state machine diagrams in SRS?","<p>Recently I am working on a SRS documentation for my university project. When I draw the state machine diagrams I'm confused for what parts should I draw it. Is that for the components? or for the classes?</p>
<p>Clearly the inherent state of the object shows in the state diagrams. But, my question is how do we find for what we should draw states. Is that get from the components or classes?</p>
","<uml><state-machine><requirements><state-diagram><system-analysis>","62992886","<p>An SRS is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">System Requirement Specification</a>: you document the requirements and not the solution. So the state diagram in the SRS should be <strong>related to the requirements</strong>, whatever they are.</p>
<p>In UML, state-machines are defined for classifiers. They can define event driven behaviors (<a href=""https://www.uml-diagrams.org/state-machine-diagrams.html#behavioral-state-machine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">behavioral state-machine</a>) or the valid set of interactions with the classifier (<a href=""https://www.uml-diagrams.org/protocol-state-machine-diagrams.html#protocol-state-machine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">protocol state-machine</a>).  A <a href=""https://www.uml-diagrams.org/classifier.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">classifier</a> is typically a class or a component: both are possible.</p>
<p>But in your SRS you don't care:  you don't need to provide an SM for every class or every component; you need to provide an SM only if there are state-related requirements.</p>
<p>Dummy examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The user may create a <code>shopping basket</code>, and add <code>items</code> from the <code>catalog</code> to the cart.  Items may also be removed.  The user may view the shopping cart and continue  the purchases.  The user can check-out the shopping cart, and once the <code>payment</code> is completed, <em><strong>no changes shall be possible anymore</strong></em> to the cart.</li>
<li>The <code>controller</code> ignites the rocket booster.  Once the booster fuel level is detected to be empty, the controller activate the decoupling of the booster, and ignites the main engine. Once the booster is succesfully decoupled, the controller shall monitor any variation in altitude.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>You'd certainly model 1 with classes, and the constraints about the validity of operations on <code>shopping cart</code> are easily expressed in a state-machine.  This is, by the way, typical for any object that has a life-cycle that is to be tracked.  The other classes seem not to have any interesting state to model.</p>
<p>You'd certainly model 2 with a <code>controller</code> component, and the event-driven set of behaviors are easily and clearly expressed with a state-machine.</p>
<p>So ultimately, you do not care if it is a class or a component.  The only thing that should drive your modelling in the SRS, is if there are behavior or constraints that <em><strong>CAN be expressed more precisely/easily/clearly</strong></em> with a state machine.  Many SRS don't even show any state-machine, because the states emerge only in the design of the solution.</p>

"62546088","Non functional requirements and functional requirement example","<p>I am analyzing Milk teas management website,  that is a web online to help user buys via online and seller can manage their products, orders</p>
<p>I have to do Non-functional requirements and functional requirements for this website like this</p>
<p>FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Register</p>
<p>Login</p>
<p>Add products to card</p>
<p>Submit order</p>
<p>Cancel order</p>
<p>NON - FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Number of milk tea can be added to the cart</p>
<p>I am right for that? Can you give me some idea for this to let me improve better, I am new for this section, thank you so much</p>
","<requirements>","62546520","<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>Good functional requirements should clearly describe the behavior of the system. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;If the user enters the wrong password 3 times when signing in, the account shall be locked for 24h.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;When an electronics product is added to the cart, the user shall be presented with an option to purchase a warranty.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;If a user attempts to cancel an order after it has been processed, the user must specify the reason for the cancellation, which must be approved before a refund is issued&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to add more functionality, create more requirements, don't pile them all into one. For example, the last requirement in the above list can be split into 2: (1) require cancellation reason, (2) approval before refund. It also helps to organize requirements by feature in spreadsheets (one row per requirement) or JIRA Stories, for example.</p>
<p>Make sure you read many examples of well-written requirements, and practice. Follow a checklist, and have a co-worker review your work. <strong>Always</strong> ask yourselves how you would test each requirement. If you can't figure out how to write a test for the requirement, how can you ever prove the product works as intended?</p>
<h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>Non-functional requirements are also known as &quot;quality attributes&quot; or &quot;constraints&quot; of the system. The range of possible items that can be added to a cart (0..max) seems like a constraint on that field, so I can see how some would consider this a NFR. But how would you test it?</p>
<p>Instead, you can express this like a functional requirement: &quot;When the user enters a value that is greater than the maximum, display an error message&quot;. A NFR might describe the color, size and location of the error message. NFRs can also specify which UI kit to use and style guidelines to follow. For example, &quot;Must follow Google Material Design&quot; (<a href=""https://material.io"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://material.io</a>).</p>
<p>You should also be familiar with NFR categories (also known as the &quot;ilities&quot;):</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Stability</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Scalability</li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Testability</li>
<li>Traceability/Auditability</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Compliance/Certification</li>
<li>Much More: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement#Examples"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement#Examples</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of NFRs for a website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance: &quot;A new user account shall be created in less than 2000 ms&quot;</li>
<li>Reliability: &quot;The system shall have at least 99.9% availability&quot;</li>
<li>Capacity: &quot;The system shall service up to 1000 simultaneous users&quot;</li>
<li>Scalability: &quot;The system shall be horizontally scalable to increase the number of simultaneous users&quot;</li>
<li>Usability: &quot;Users should be able to navigate to any page in the site within 3 clicks&quot;</li>
</ul>

"61542567","Non-interactive functional requirements software engineering","<p>I'm having a problem with listing some non-interactive functional requirements for building a project about ""Smart food court system for a university"" with self-service. In that system, customer can order through mobile app or machine, pay by e-wallet, and when ordering by machine, the machine will automatic print a bill after payment. I can't understand clearly what a concept non-interactive functional requirements in software engineering. And with the example that machine print a bill automatically after payment is a non-interactive functional requirements or not? Can anyone give more examples about non-interactive functional requirements to help me understand clearly? Thank you!</p>
","<software-design><use-case><requirements><use-case-diagram>","63115953","<p>The concept of <em><strong>non-interactive requirement</strong></em> is not a  common nor well-defined terminology in software engineering.</p>
<p>Interactive requirements are about what the system shall do in response to a user action, or to enable a user action.</p>
<p>Automatically printing a bill is therefore an interactive requirement: even if the printing is by itself not interactive, the sheer fact of enabling the user to pick the bill makes it interactive.</p>
<p>Interactive requirements are captured in the use-cases or in UI requirements. Non-interactive requirements are all the rest, for example:</p>
<ul>

"61405379","Requirements diagram possibilities with use cases and test cases","<p>I am wondering what is allowed (or at least what is the best practice) in a SysML Requirements diagram regarding the use of satisfy/verify links between use-cases, test-cases and requirements.</p>

<p>As I understand it, generally, a use-case &lt;&lt; satisfy >> a requirement, and a test-case &lt;&lt; verify >> it.</p>

<p>Is-it possible though for a use-case to &lt;&lt; verify >> a requirement?</p>

<p>I found different sources with contradictory statements on the matter.</p>

<p>For the classical Alarm-Clock example, with :</p>

<p>Req1 : To be waken at chosen time. </p>

<p>UseCase1 : Set an alarm time &amp; a radio frequency.</p>

<p>Test1 : Given there is a station at 101.5FM and the time is correctly set, when i set an alarm future time and set the freq to 101.5FM, then I will listen to the station at the given time.</p>

<p>What is then the correct and/or best diagram ?</p>

<p>(UseCase1) -- satisfy --> [Req1] ,  [TestCase1] -- verify --> [Req1]</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>(UseCase1) -- satisfy --> [Req1] ,  [TestCase1] -- verify --> (UseCase1)</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>(UseCase1) -- verify --> [Req1] ,  [TestCase1] -- verify --> [Req1]</p>

<p>Thanks for any clarifications!</p>
","<requirements><sysml>","62182144","<p>There is no formal constraint in the specification, that would disallow this. However, the semantics of the elements makes this meaningless.</p>

<p><strong>How would a use case verify a requirement?</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SysML:</strong> A Verify relationship is a dependency between a requirement and a test
  case or other model element that can determine whether a system
  fulfills the requirement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A use case describes all the ways a system can be used to achieve a certain goal. It describes user actions as well as functions the system must have to be helpful for achieving this goal. It doesn't describe how to test the system functions. You can however derive test cases from a use case description.</p>

<p><strong>How would a use case satisfy a requirement?</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SysML:</strong> A Satisfy relationship is a dependency between a requirement and a
  model element that fulfills the requirement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A use case is an analysis tool to find the functions, that the system shall support - in other words, the functional requirements. How can an analysis tool that finds requirements satisfy a requirement?</p>

<p><strong>About your example</strong> </p>

<p>What is the goal of the use case ""set an alarm time and radio frequency""? The alarm time and the radio frequency are set? Well, forgive me, but this is not really helpful. </p>

<p>The use case refines the stakeholder requirement ""Be waken at chosen time"" and has the same name. And this use case has a lot of alternative flows, that most clock makers in their blissfull ignorance forget: I awake early and want to prematurly cancel the alarm (without clearing it for the next day). I pressed the snooze button, but now, that I'm awake, decide to get up anyway (and while I'm under the shower, the alarm goes off). I stayed up late, and now need to strike a balance between a minimum sleep requirement and a full to do list (and would like to know, without calculating late at night, how much time would be left). All these alternative flows lead to additional functional requirements.</p>

<p>So the complete list of functional requirements found in this use case would be: </p>

<ul>
<li>set Alarm time</li>
<li>select Radio or Alarm</li>
<li>set Radio Frequency</li>
<li>control clock for alarming (main function)

<ul>
<li>play Radio at predefined time</li>
<li>sound alarm at predefined time</li>
<li>snooze alarm</li>
<li>cancel Alarm for today </li>
<li>clear Alarm time</li>
<li>show time until alarm </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It is amazing how many alarm clocks fail to have all these functions, given that a use case analysis would find them quickly.</p>

<p>So the diagram could be:</p>

<p>«stakeholder requirement» <code>be waken at chosen time</code><br>
&lt;-«refine»- «use case» <code>be waken at chosen time</code><br>
&lt;-«trace»- «functional requirement» <code>cancel Alarm for today</code><br>
&lt;-«satisfy»- «operation» <code>cancel Alarm</code> </p>

<p>«functional requirement» <code>cancel Alarm for today</code><br>
&lt;-«verify»- «testcase» <code>cancel Alarm after snooze</code> </p>

<p>You could argue, that the stakeholder requirement, and, thus indirectly the use case could get verified by a test case. However, I think that a stakeholder requirement would get validated, not verified.</p>

<p>The use cases are different depending on whether the client is:</p>

<li><p>The 3) Foreign clients' orders are always accepted no matter what.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This right here is where I run into trouble and need help with. </p>

<p>The orders from nglish clients that have a criminal record are always denied UNLESS they are an administration.</p>

<p>What are the most optimal actor choices here? I thought of going with <code>English client</code>, and <code>Foreign clients</code> but I don't know how to include the ""Unless the client is an administration"" in the use case.</p>
","<uml><actor><use-case><requirements>","60790466","<p>Actors in UML use-cases are classifiers.  To decide about which actors to create requires to understand the actors their goals and behaviours and how they differ in the interaction with the system.      </p>

<p>First of all, you need to clarify the super-ambiguous requirements:  </p>

<ul>
<li>""<em>English client</em>"":  is this a client with English nationality?  Is it a client that lives permanently in the UK?  Is this a client with an address in the UK? Is it a client with a +44 phone number?  </li>
<li>""<em>Foreign client</em>"": same kind of questions + can you define for sure the difference between Ensglish and Foreign?  For example: what with bi-nationals? what with people having two addresses one being abroad?  </li>
<li>""<em>Using this service more than three years</em>"":  what with a foreign customer who uses the service for 3 years and then settles in the UK?  </li>
<li>Since you deliver goods, you might also need to consider a delivery address.  What with an English client ordering on a foreign address or vis-versa ? </li>
<li>""<em>criminal record</em>"":  the criminal record might change over time:  is it provided at each purchase? or is it part of the customer registration process ?  In the latter case,  is there a need to periodically renew this information ?  </li>
</ul>

<p>Use-cases should in principle be goal oriented.  So a use-case represents a goal for a user who is going to interact with the system to achieve the goal.  Use-cases are not meant to describe the detailed sequence of your process (if client is this, do that, etc...) and neither are actors meant for that purpose.  </p>

<p>You should therefore consider reformulating the use-cases to represent how the actors would perceive them. If needed you may consider the status of the actor that could explain that an actor behaves very differently. Typically in your case, I could imagine :  </p>

<ul>
<li>New client: a new client may want to provide details (address, identification) or evidence that they are entitled to buy (criminal record - I suppose your activity is regulated if you request such details)</li>
<li>Public administration:  behavior of administration in purchase is anyway different because of public procurement and legal constraints. </li>
<li>Privately owned company:  behavior is different since it can involve several persons,  </li>
<li>Private individual </li>
</ul>

<p>The need to pay an advance fee seem to depend on the address, nationality, history.  It's more related to the process (it's a part of it) than an independent goal for an actor. So I would neither show this as a use-case nor make different actors for this purpose.   </p>

<p>The reason to deny an order is not something that is not relevant for the customer (no customer has a goal go get  a purchase denied!).  It's relevant to you and your system and is a consequence of the registration process.  So no need to have a dedicated actor for that.    </p>

<ul>
<li>Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer. ( You can find minSDKVersion from android studio app gradle file)</li>

"59739151","NP Hard's relation to Requirements Engineering","<p>I want to know about NP-Hard from a requirements engineering point of view and not mathematical. Any input is appreciated.</p>
","<requirements><np><np-hard><requirements-management>","59740361","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_engineering"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Requirements engineering</a> is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process.The only connection to NP-hard problems I can imagine is the following:<br>
If a problem should be solved by an algorithm, require that an algorithm is used that is not NP-hard.<br>
NP-hard means essentially (not mathematically) that one has to compute all possible solutions to a problem, and than select the best one.<br>
The typical example is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Traveling Salesman Problem</a>:<br>
Given a number of cities to visit, find the shortest visit that visited each city once.<br>
To find the shortest route, all possible routes have to be constructed, and the shortest one has then to be selected. The time to find this best solution grows exponentially with the number of cities, i.e. for a larger number of cities it is not solvable.<br>
PS: Of course, there are algorithms that solve this particular problem pretty well in reasonable time.</p>
"
"59734348","Is this Use Case correct?","<p>Its my first time making a use case and this is for my coursework.
I had to follow the case study below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Case Study 8:</strong> Warehouse Control System (WCS)<br/>
  A warehouse distributes health food and related products. Customers order a particular
  product and quantity from the warehouse. The Warehouse Control System WCS saves the
  order and provides to the customer the order number. The WCS generates a pick list and
  shopping label, which tells the order-picker person how many of each item to pick to fulfil
  the order. The order-picker picks the items, places them in the box, and places the shipping
  label on it. The order-picker then uses the WCS to specify whether the order is ready or
  not. Then the manager sends the order number, address, and the payment data to the
  shipping company. At the end of the day, the shipping company arrives to pick up all the
  orders. The inventory of the product in stock is carried out by the staff, but in others, it is
  outsourced to an external company. Each staff has a specific function which is either to
  raise an order or check the re-order level of the products in stock.<br/>
  The company wants to create a computer system that allows employees and external
  companies to access the application system on desktop. Model, design and implement a
  GUI client that can access the database using Visual Studio or any other software
  development package. The database must be designed from the class model and the entity
  data model using MS Access or Oracle database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure:  should the Warehouse Control System (WCS) be an actor ? If not how to make the use case without it? </p>

<p>Here the use case I made:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w9AAT.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w9AAT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<li><code>Order ready</code> and the like are no use cases</li>
<li>Try to not start  functional decomposition (like it seems you did with that <code>Order ready</code></li>

"59585038","Best practice on mocdeling threshold (T) and objective (O) requirements in SysML?","<p>I have considered making a new requirement stereotype for which I can make threshold and objective attributes.  That is fine as far as capturing the requirement goes, but then becomes ugly when trying to do verification.  I'm starting to think they must be captured as separate requirements, which may also be ugly when doing traceability, satisfactions and verifications.  </p>

<p>For example, my requirement says ""The system shall be no more than 100kg. (T)"" and ""The system shall be no more than 80kg. (O)"" </p>

<p>Tracing this (or a similarly stated requirement) becomes ""ugly"" when making a test plan and showing which requirement has been satisfied.  If (O) is satisfied, then clearly (T) is also. However, the system will still pass test even though it may fail the verification for (O).  Perhaps it is standard to carry some requirements (O) that are not met.  I am new to this modeling method-so just curious. I wanted to know if there is already a best practice out there. I have been looking and haven't found anything that addresses this.</p>
","<uml><requirements><sysml><requirements-management>","59757684","<p>From what I understood, you want to model, that a certain performance requirement has two values, a threshold and an objective. Meeting the objective is optional, but meeting the threshold is mandatory. In the test plan, the requirement will be shown as satisfied, if the design meets the threshold. Whether it also meets the objective could be evaluated with a model report, but that is only informative and doesn’t have any effect on the test outcome.</p>

<p>I would create a new stereotype «performance requirement» specializing «abstractRequirement» and «ConstraintBlock» (as described in the SysML specification Annex E.8.2). When you use this Stereotype, you need to add three parameters: <code>actualMass</code>, <code>thresholdMass</code> and <code>objectiveMass</code>. The constraint will be <code>{actualMass&lt;thresholdMass}</code>. The <code>objectiveMass</code> is then just informative (I have to think it through, how this could get used for reporting).</p>

"59430910","What is the difference between Architectural drivers/factors and architectural significant requirements","<p>I need to be able to explain the terms: architectural factor, architectural driver and architectural significant requirement. i found out that an architectural factor/driver are the same (correct me if i'm wrong).
but when i look up their definitions i get the following explanation:</p>

<p><strong>architectural driver:</strong>
Architectural drivers are formally defined as the set of requirements that have significant influence over your architecture.</p>

<p><strong>architecturally significant requirements:</strong>
architecturally significant requirements are those requirements that play an important role in determining the architecture of the system.</p>

<p>it seems to me both of them are requirements that have influence your architecture, however in the book of larman they are clearly introduced as 2 different things.</p>

","<architecture><requirements>","60328053","<p>Good question! They are indeed confusing.

In such cases you could relate that to the boundary rather than a single use case. That will indicate it's some ""global"" requirement (similar to a non-functional requirement). Usually in a project you start with a more or less strange mix of requirements mixed in user stories. The business analyst (BA) has to comb that information and come up with decent use cases (synthesize the added values). The system architect (with the BA) will then go through requirements and use cases to come up with a (business) class model.</p>

","<uml><modeling><use-case><requirements><use-case-diagram>","58735870","<h3>About requirements</h3>

<p>First, let's handle the requirement question: </p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">functional requirement</a> tells something about what a software shall do. Everything related to goal, the gameplay or the rules of the game, is a functional requirement.</li>
<li>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non functional requirement</a> tells something about how the software shall be, for example how accurate, how performant, how easy to use, how easy to maintain. Your narrative shows no such requirements.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>About use-cases</h2>

<p>Use case driven software development methods start with the high-level user's goals that are captured in use-cases. Personally, I see only one such goal:  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QkPWW.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QkPWW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>Very rare usage</strong>:  a <a href=""https://www.uml-diagrams.org/use-case-actor-association.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">multiplicity on the actor side</a> of the use case.  This says that 2 or more instances of players are involved in an instance of the use case.  Of course, this makes sense only for the game as a whole, not for individual actions (like you have in your diagram). </p>

<p>In your diagram, you have shown 3 use cases: </p>

<ul>
<li>is <code>EndTurn</code> an independent goal that the user may freely decide to chose ?  No ! It's what always follows a player action.  So this is definitely not a use case.  </li>
<li>you say that <code>RotateDials</code> <a href=""https://www.uml-diagrams.org/use-case-extend.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extends</a> <code>ChooseDials</code>. This means that a player could <code>ChooseDials</code> but not rorate it.  Is this a valid scenario ?    </li>
<li>if on the other hand you'd say that <code>ChooseDials</code> <a href=""https://www.uml-diagrams.org/use-case-include.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">includes</a> <code>RotateDials</code>, the latter would always happen. But then, wouldn't <code>ChooseDial</code> not be more than just choosing a dial ?  Shouldn't it then be called <code>PlayTurn</code> ?  </li>
</ul>

<p>I could understand that for learning purpose, you'd want to decompose the <code>Play game</code> in more detailed use-cases.  Typically, once the players try to reach their goal <code>Play game</code>, this might include sub-goals of <code>Play  turn</code>.  As long as it is goal-oriented, and not too detailed, this is ok.  But do <a href=""https://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/process/modguide/md_ucmod.htm#Avoiding%20Functional%20Decomposition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">avoid simple functional decomposition</a> (it doesn't help for being more user-driven, and use-cases are not functions ). And, above all, do not misuse a use-case diagram for trying to show a sequence of <a href=""https://www.uml-diagrams.org/activity-diagrams.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">activities</a>.       </p>

<h2>Requirement traceability</h2>

<p>The use cases do not capture the full requirements.  It captures the most enssential thing:  the purpose of the system and the user goals.  </p>

<p>When writing down the requirements, it's then useful to get guided by the use-cases and their narrative, and to trace-back every use-case specific requirement.    </p>

<p>But of course, there are some general requirements as well.  These are not specific to a particular use-case. Some are even common to all use case. Mark these as general requirements (e.g. use case <code>*</code>).    </p>

<p>it still uses the <code>operator&lt;</code> to do so, and not the <code>operator&gt;</code>, so the former has to be defined for the class/type of the objects stored in the container.

Again these stand for demanding something and for providing something.</p>

<p>I know that <code>Requirements-Capability</code> model was only introduced later on in the development of the OSGi specification(s). Can't exactly find at what year and version it was presented. </p>

<p>But,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why has this been added to the specification? I don't see what it has more to offer than what the <code>Import</code>/<code>Export-package</code> already offered: creating dependencies on other packages/bundles?</p></li>
<li><p>Could someone give me a better understanding in the difference (pro's and con's) between these 2 sets of concepts?</p></li>
</ul>
","<java><osgi><requirements><capability>","57415720","<p>When we started with OSGi in 1998 we had some clear requirements but of course, no clear view of what would come out of it. So we started to explicitly model the requirements and capabilities we had: packages. The Import-Package requires a capability and that capability is provided by an Export-Package. </p>

<p>In 2003 Eclipse wanted to start using OSGi but they need a facility to require another bundle, they did not like the idea of exporting and importing all their packages. Actually, at that time they failed to see the benefit of packages. To satisfy them we added Require-Bundle and Fragment-Host (another one of their desires that turned out not to be so good.) </p>

<p>After we specified OSGi 4.x with these extensions we starting thinking about a repository, Richard had developed the Oscar Bundle Repository. Analyzing the situation with the new headers in OSGi 4.0 it became clear that the implementation of Import-Package looked a lot like Require-Bundle, and even resembled Fragment-Host processing. </p>

<p>In 2006 Richard S. Hall and I wrote <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/barchart/barchart-service/OBR-RFC-112.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">RFC 112</a> proposing a more generic model that captured the semantics of the existing dependency model but was not specific for each <em>type</em> of requirement. I.e. for the Framework <em>resolver</em> the Import-Package and Require-Bundle only differ in their <em>namespace</em>. Thinking of Import-Package as a generic requirement and Export-Package as a generic capability made the repository model extremely simple. Even better, it was extendable since we could always add more namespaces. This made the resolver completely independent of the actual namespaces used.</p>

<p>After some very heated discussions, the OSGi Core Platform Expert Group decided to accept the basic idea and developed the Requirements and Capabilities specifications. Although this was originally a model for the repository, it turned out to be highly useful for the Framework itself. We decided therefore to adapt the existing specifications to this model. OSGi 4.3 internally models the Import-Package, Export-Package, Require-Bundle, etc. as requirements and capabilities of a <em>resource</em> (the bundle). For backward compatibility, we kept the existing headers but they are internally translated to requirements and capabilities.</p>

<p>Then finally to the answer to your question. Over time the OSGi specifications added more and more <em>namespaces</em>. A namespace is like a <em>type</em> for a Requirement and a Capability. It defines the semantics of a set of properties of a Capability in that namespace. A Requirement is a filter expression that is asserted on those properties. A <em>Resource</em> has a set of Capabilities that are provided to the runtime when all its Requirements are satisfied. It is the task of the <em>Resolver</em> to find a set of resources that are all satisfied with each other's capabilities and capabilities provided by the runtime.</p>

<p>For example, we added the <code>osgi.ee</code> namespace that defines exactly on what VM's the bundle can run. We added the <code>osgi.extender</code> namespace that models a dependency on an external program like the Service Component Runtime (SCR). Most SCR components do not require any package from the SCR itself, we tried hard to make them as independent as possible. However, a SCR component will sit useless unless some bundle in the runtime provides the SCR functionality. Notice that this cannot use Require-Bundle because there are multiple implementations of SCR. I think there are about 20 namespaces. Each namespace is defined in a <code>Namespace</code> class.</p>

<p>This model has given the OSGi a number of advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cohesion</strong> Although the specification has added many namespaces the resolver implementations never had to change since they worked on the generic model.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-Grained</strong> OSGi bundles are unique in how they describe their dependencies in a very fine-grained way. All module systems I know tend to use the simple module-to-module dependency that does not allow substitution.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible</strong> Since the Framework reifies the dependencies between bundles it is possible in runtime to leverage these dependencies. For example, in OSGi enRoute I linked a bundle to its web page traversing these runtime wirings. </li>
</ul>

<p>I personally consider the Requirements and Capability model of OSGi one of its best kept secrets. As far as I can see it could be used in a lot of areas to improve many development projects into the world of software engineering.</p>

<p>The only disappointing part in this question is that I thought we'd described this pretty well in the <a href=""https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/framework.module.html#framework.module.dependencies"" rel=""noreferrer"">Core specification</a>? :-)</p>

","<java><osgi><requirements><capability>","57415762","<p>The <a href=""https://blog.osgi.org/2015/12/using-requirements-and-capabilities.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">requirements and capabilities</a> model is an extension of the Import/Export package model. Actually you can express a package import as a requirement and a package export as a capability.</p>

<p>Exporting / Importing packages allows for loose coupling. You export an API and the client imports it. This way the client only needs to know about the API so loose coupling is achieved.</p>

<p>At a later stage when you assemble the application out of bundles this loose coupling makes it difficult to automate the process.</p>

<p>If you just provide your client bundle to a resolver then it can only automatically find that you need the bundle that provides the API. If the implementation of the API is in a different bundle then the resolver has no way to know that you need it.</p>

<p>This is where requirements can help. Let's take the <a href=""https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.http.whiteboard.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTTP Whiteboard model</a>. A bundle that want to publish a servlet needs to import the servlet api package but is also needs to express that it wants an implementation of the osgi http whiteboard. </p>

<p>This can be expressed by the requirement with namespace=""osgi.implementation"", name=""osgi.http"", version=""1.1.0"". As this is difficult to writer by hand there is annotation support for it.</p>

<pre><code>@HttpWhiteboardServletPattern(""/myservlet"")
@Component(service = Servlet.class)
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) 
            throws IOException {
        resp.getWriter().println(""Hello"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The annotation @HttpWhiteboardServletPattern indirectly translates to the requirement above.</p>

<p>So when you build a bundle with this class it will import the servlet api package and also have a requirement for an http whiteboard implementation.</p>

<p>Now if you look at an implementation bundle like the felix http service you will see that it provide the capability for the whiteboard impl.</p>

<p>So if you have a OSGi repository with your bundle, the servlet API and the felix http service. Then the resolver can provide you with a complete application if you only give it your bundle. </p>

<li>You should NEVER give any meaning to the absolute number other than uniqueness (perhaps QSS should have used timestamps or UUIDS instead of integers for their absolute numbers when they designed DOORS, this would make the situation clearer). You will have to rework “some reasons” . Perhaps you use a different mechanism to assign your own ID mechanism or you have to evaluate whether the requirement “generate consecutive numbers without gaps” is really necessary.</li>

<p>Software design is about the <strong>structure and the behavior</strong> of the software.   If some statement seems arbitrary and you think the software could fulfil all the requirements but differently, then there are chances that it's more about design than requirements.  A design objective tells what the design must ensure (ambiguous: at the stage of the requirements, it's difficult to make the difference between non functional requirements and design objective).  A design decision is a decision on the behavior or the structure of the software.     </p>

<ol>
<li>What the software shall do ==> Functional requirement (FR) <br/> If we'd change this, the software would no longer do what is expected, so it can't be a design decision. </li>
<li>How the software shall be ==> Non functional requirement (NFR) <br/> Not really about structure or behavior of the software. The language will not impact use case nor class model, so it's not really a design decision IMHO.   </li>
<li>Arbitrary decision about cardinality in object model ==> Design decision (DD) </li>
<li>""aim in the design"" ==> Design objective (DO) </li>
<li>What the software shall do ==> FR</li>
<li>Arbitrary constraint about object model ==> DD<br/>If it would be no less than 3 or no less than 10, the software would still fulfil the functional requirements.  However this depends on the context.  If it would turn out that the software would not be fit for purpose if these limits would not be respected, then it could be FR. </li>
<li>Arbitrary constraint on object model ==> DD<br/>The purpose of this statement is unclear.  It looks like some arbitrary constraints that could allow to generalize some categories. </li>
<li>What the software shall do ==> FR  </li>
<li>Arbitrary decision on the interaction ==> DD<br/> I think that the data could be entered at another moment, or in a different way (3 times 1 month).  Therefore I think it is DD.  However, one could argue that the system shall offer a 3 month planning.  So FR cannot be excluded, although I would expect it to be expressed differently.   </li>

Like calidation or credentials?</p>
","<uml><use-case><requirements><use-case-diagram>","53360841","<p>Not in the UC diagram, but there are others where you might.</p>

<h2>Use Case diagram</h2>

<p>UC will show external systems that are involved in the UC as actors. The UC itself shows functionality of modeled systems and should no go to low with decomposition. Things like ""communicate with external system"" or ""validate query"" are not separate UCs but part of something broader like ""Place an order"". On this level you only show the main function, leaving details for other, more specific diagrams (e.g. activity diagram depicting the UC's flow).</p>

<h2>Activity diagram</h2>

<p>On activity diagram you show the information about processing but in general you do not show too much static data. As a result things like ""Validate query"" or ""Create notification e-mail"" will be separate actions within the activity. They may have be further decomposed as Activities with details about how validation is performed or what steps has to be performed to communicate with the system.</p>

<h1>Sequence diagram</h1>

<p>Sequence diagram is another great way of showing the flow of action, especially when communication between various parties (e.g. systems) is involved. Here you can show the order of messages being sent, to some degree actions taken (as called operations - so you can show that you run validation first and send the message to the e-mail system then if the validation was successful). With the operation you can also show information about parameters that has to be provided (so for example credentials for communication with external systems).</p>

<h2>Other diagrams</h2>

<p>It all depends on the specific diagram and most of them give you a possibility to show the other system in some way. Sometimes there is more than one good way to do so. Details would depend on what exactly you want to show and which diagram did you choose to present the information</p>

<p>I would suggest you read some good books about modelling with the use of UML. Craig Larman's ""Applying UML and patterns"" or Howard Podesva's ""UML for the IT business analysis"" are my usual starting recommendations.</p>

"52858824","How do we gather and document non-functional requirements in Agile","<p>I know in waterfall, they are gathered and documented at an early stage of SDLC, I believe very first stage. Therefore, they are captured and documented before development and testing even starts.</p>

<p>But I am confused how is that done in Agile? </p>

<p>If I understand correctly, user stories should be written with acceptance criteria which capture non-functional requirements. But in Agile, we pick project, create it, and start working on it right away.  </p>

<p>So, my guess is that someone (perhaps product owner) goes through user stories and collects acceptance criteria into a formatted document which then becomes Non-Functional-Requirements document?</p>
","<agile><requirements>","52859874","<p>First, to answer your question, I must be clear that no Agile frameworks or methodologies attempt to define everything that a team might need to do (especially Scrum) so there is nothing wrong with adding extra artifacts or practices that the team finds useful as long as they aren't contradicting a defined practice.</p>

<p>There are a few places I typically see non-functional requirements recorded. Here are a few of the most common ones:</p>

<p><strong>Definition of Done</strong></p>

<p>The definition of done contains standards for quality that should be applied across all backlog items that come through. Often times this includes things like ""n% unit test coverage of code"", ""code and configuration changes have been peer reviewed"", and ""all automated regression tests have been run and pass"". I've sometimes seen broader non-functional requirements like ""no changes cause the application load time to exceed X ms"".</p>

<p><strong>Architectural Design Documents</strong></p>

<p>You can still have these in Agile. Rather than establishing the finished architecture at the beginning of the project, they introduce constraints that the architecture has to stay within. As the project progresses and architectural decisions are made or changed, these documents are updated to reflect that information. Examples of constraints may include ""System X is considered to be the authoritative source of customer personal data"" or ""Details needed for payment processing should never be available to a public-facing server in order to reduce attack opportunities on that data.""</p>

<p><strong>Product Chartering</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the project, ""starting right away"" is a bit fluid. On very large projects or products, it is not uncommon to take a few days (in my experience, 1 - 3 is a good number) to charter the project. This would include identifying personas, making sure business stakeholders and team members have a shared understanding of the vision, talk through some expected user experiences and problems at a high level, etc. It is very common that non-functional needs come out here and should be recorded either in the DoD, existing architectural documents, or in some cases, in backlog items. One good example of this happening is something called a trade-off matrix. When building a tradeoff matrix, we talk about constraints on the project like performance, adaptability, feature set, budget, time, etc. We identify one as a primary constraint, two as secondary, and all others are considered tertiary. This isn't a hard-and-fast rule, but it establishes an general understanding of how trade-offs on non-functional needs will be decided in the work.</p>

<p><strong>Backlog Items</strong></p>

<p>Ok, last one. Not all backlog items have to be User Stories. If you have an actionable non-functional requirement (set up a server, reconfigure a firewall, team needs to convert to a new version of the IDE) there is nothing that stops you from creating a backlog item for this. It isn't a User Story, but that's ok. I will warn that most teams find a correlation between the number of items in the backlog that are User Stories and their ability to effectively deliver value and adapt to changes along the way, so don't get carries away. But I'd rather see a team put in a non-US in their backlog than try to pass off those things as user stories like ""As a firewall, I want to be updated, so we don't get h@XX0rD"" &lt;- real backlog item I saw.</p>

<p>As a final note: remember that in Agile, we strive to adapt to change, so don't worry about getting the DoD or architectural document perfect the first time. It can change as you learn more.</p>

<p>After living through that approach, we don't want go back down that road for the following reasons:
1) Once that feature is shipped, it becomes extremely difficult to locate the info. Who remembers what feature was done in what user story?
2) No centralized place to store feature documentation. Of course, we all don't want take the waterfall approach of spending 2 years writing feature requirements, but there is something to be said of having a centralized place organized by feature area that contains the relevant documentation.
3) Have you ever tried to read an extensive user story with requirements acceptance testing through either the web interface or through Visual Studio? It gets old pretty fast having to read through a 8 line window.</p>

"52021074","why templated non const parameter constructor is preferred to given copy constructor","<p>I want to make my class be able to be used in a <code>std::variant</code>.</p>

<p>The simply code that should work is:</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
    std::variant&lt; int, A &gt; v;

    A a(1);
    v = a;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My class contains a templated constructor:</p>

<pre><code> template &lt;typename T&gt; A( T&amp; );
</code></pre>

<p>At this point the trouble starts! The constructor binds to the call from <code>std::variant</code> and not the provided <code>A(const A&amp;)</code> is used anymore.</p>

<p>For copy&amp;paste reasons the full example here:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;variant&gt;

class A
{
    private:
        int x;

    public:

        A( A&amp;&amp;) {}
        A( const A&amp; ) {}
        A(){}
        ~A() {}

        A&amp; operator=( const A&amp; ) { return *this;}
        A&amp; operator=( A&amp;&amp; ) {return *this;}

        template &lt;typename T&gt;
            A( T&amp; t  ) 
            {
                std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt; std::endl;
            }

        A(int _x):x{_x}{}
};

int main()
{
    std::variant&lt; int, A &gt; v;

    A a(1);
    v = a;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>Why the template here?
The problem starts while using a constructor which takes a serializer type. The serializer can have multiple types, depends on files or streams to serialize with.</p>

<p>Remark: I know that the functionality of the constructors is missing!</p>
","<c++><c++17><variant><requirements>","52021094","<p>The problem is not with <code>std::variant</code>. The problem is with the constructor template,</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
A(T&amp; t)
</code></pre>

<p>Such constructors are problematic because when the argument is a non-<code>const</code> lvalue of type <code>A</code>, this constructor is preferred over the copy constructor taking <code>const A&amp;</code>---which is usually not the intended behaviour. To prevent this, we usually constrain this constructor with SFINAE:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T, typename = std::enable_if_t&lt;!std::is_same_v&lt;std::decay_t&lt;T&gt;, A&gt;&gt;&gt;
A(T&amp; t)  // or T&amp;&amp; t
</code></pre>

<p>and might consider making it <code>explicit</code> as well.</p>

<p>We usually do not provide copy constructors taking non-<code>const</code> <code>A&amp;</code>, since they are redundant next to the ones taking <code>const A&amp;</code>.</p>

"51535618","Best practices for including large resource folder into java project","<p>I'm working on a project where having access to a big resource folder (structure with thousand of little images) is required. The client want to offer the app through a native installation (which includes the JVM that the app require to run).

Giving this, I can't package all the app with a resource folder in a jar file, as far as i know jar files are not installables.

","<java><jar><resources><packaging><requirements>","51650404","<p><strong>MY WRONGS:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>As @Joop Egen told in his answer, one of my problem was my folder structure in the project. I was not following the maven convention of putting the resource folder in the src/main/ folder it's because of this all the solutions i were trying didn't have the necessary scope to get the resource folder. </p></li>
<li><p>I didn't know how jar files work with java. For java .jar files are a collection (not a Collection of java) of jar entries to every single file within them. In my single case, the .jar file was created using the Eclipse export wizard and didn't have any reference to folders, it just had references to files. So it's simply IMPOSSIBLE to get a folder with all its content. </p></li>
<li><p>I used the java JarFile class to manage the content but this class doesn't offer methods to manage files like java File class does. So it's not as easy to do as it is with another kind of files.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WHAT I'VE DONE:</strong> <br>
I've developed a code to read all the file entries in the .jar, discriminate the ones i was interested to. And then extract them to a directory within the app. By doing this i had standard access to them and, if i want to, i can simply remove the directory when the application closes. I was trying to use them directly from the jar but jar files are zip files so in some moment that inner files need to be extrated from the jar to somewhere as OS do with zip files. It's can a be a temp directory or not.</p>

"50963447","Swift - Conform third-party type to my own protocol with conflicting requirement","<p>Here's the boiled down situation:</p>

<p>Let's say a third-party framework written by Alice Allman provides a very useful class:</p>

<pre><code>public class AATrackpad {
  public var cursorLocation: AAPoint = .zero
}
</code></pre>

<p>and another framework written by Bob Bell provides a different class:</p>

<pre><code>public class BBMouse {
  public var where_is_the_mouse: BBPoint = .zero
}
</code></pre>

<p>At runtime either one of these classes may be needed depending on which piece of hardware the user has decided to use. Therefore, in keeping with the <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhCYaYDn8EgMjdlMWIzNGUtZTQ0NC00ZjQ5LTkwYzQtZjRhMDRlNTQ3ZGMz/view"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dependency Inversion Principle</a>, I do not want my own types to depend on <code>AATrackpad</code> or <code>BBMouse</code> directly. Rather, I want to define a protocol which describes the behaviors I need:</p>

<pre><code>protocol CursorInput {
  var cursorLocation: CGPoint { get }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then have my own types make use of that protocol instead:</p>

<pre><code>class MyCursorDescriber {
  var cursorInput: CursorInput?

  func descriptionOfCursor () -&gt; String {
    return ""Cursor Location: \(cursorInput?.cursorLocation.description ?? ""nil"")""
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to use an instance of <code>BBMouse</code> as the cursor input, like this:</p>

<pre><code>let myCursorDescriber = MyCursorDescriber()
myCursorDescriber.cursorInput = BBMouse()
</code></pre>

<p>but in order for this to compile I have to retroactively conform <code>BBMouse</code> to my protocol:</p>

<pre><code>extension BBMouse: CursorInput {
  var cursorLocation: CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(x: self.where_is_the_mouse.x, y: self.where_is_the_mouse.y)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that I've conformed <code>BBMouse</code> to my <code>CursorInput</code> protocol, my code compiles and my architecture is the way I want it. The reason I have no problem here is that I think that <code>where_is_the_mouse</code> is a terrible name for that property, and I'm quite happy to never use that name again. However, with <code>AATrackpad</code> its a different story. I happen to think that Alice named her <code>cursorLocation</code> property perfectly, and as you can see I want to be able to use the same name for my protocol requirement. My problem is that <code>AATrackpad</code> does not use <code>CGPoint</code> as the type of this property, but instead uses a proprietary point type called <code>AAPoint</code>. The fact that my protocol requirement (<code>cursorLocation</code>) has the same name as an existing property of <code>AATrackpad</code> but a different type means that I can't retroactively conform to <code>CursorInput</code>:</p>

<pre><code>extension AATrackpad: CursorInput {
  var cursorLocation: CGPoint { // -- Invalid redeclaration
    return CGPoint(x: self.cursorLocation.x, y: self.cursorLocation.y) // -- Infinite recursion
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As the comments in that snippet say, this code does not compile, and even if it did I'd be facing an infinite recursion at runtime because I have no way to specifically reference the <code>AATrackpad</code> version of <code>cursorLocation</code>. It would be great if something like this would work <code>(self as? AATrackpad)?.cursorLocation</code>, but I don't believe this makes sense in this context. Again though, the protocol conformance won't even compile in the first place, so disambiguating in order to solve the infinite recursion is secondary.</p>

<p>With all of that context in mind, my question is:</p>

<p>If I architect my app using protocols (which is widely recommended, for good reason), is it really true that my ability to use a certain third-party concrete type depends on the hope this third-party developer doesn't share my taste for naming conventions?</p>

<hr>

<p>NOTE: The answer <strong>""Just pick a name that doesn't conflict with the types you want to use""</strong> won't be satisfactory. Maybe in the beginning I only had <code>BBMouse</code> and had no conflicts, and then a year later I decided that I wanted to add support for <code>AATrackpad</code> as well. I initially chose a great name and it's now used pervasively throughout my app - should I have to change it everywhere for the sake of one new concrete type? What happens later on when I want to add support for <code>CCStylusTablet</code>, which now conflicts with whatever new name I chose? Do I have to change the name of my protocol requirement <em>again</em>? I hope you see why I'm looking for a more sound answer than that.</p>
","<swift><protocols><conflict><requirements><dependency-inversion>","50984709","<p>Inspired by Jonas Maier's comment, I found what I believe to be an architecturally adequate solution to this problem. As Jonas said, function overloading exhibits the behavior that I'm looking for. I'm starting to think that maybe protocol requirements should only ever be functions, and not properties. Following this line of thinking, my protocol will now be:</p>

<pre><code>protocol CursorInput {
  func getCursorLocation () -&gt; CGPoint
  func setCursorLocation (_ newValue: CGPoint)
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>(Note that in this answer I'm making it settable as well, unlike in the original post.)</em></p>

<p>I can now retroactively conform <code>AATrackpad</code> to this protocol without conflict:</p>

<pre><code>extension AATrackpad: CursorInput {
  func getCursorLocation () -&gt; CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(x: self.cursorLocation.x, y: self.cursorLocation.y)
  }
  func setCursorLocation (_ newValue: CGPoint) {
    self.cursorLocation = AAPoint(newValue)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important -</strong> This will still compile even if <code>AATrackpad</code> already has a function <code>func getCursorLocation () -&gt; AAPoint</code>, which has the same name but a different type. This behavior is exactly what I was wanting from my property in the original post. Thus:</p>

<p><em>The major problem with including a property in a protocol is that it can render certain concrete types literally incapable of conforming to that protocol due to namespace collisions.</em></p>

<p>After solving this in this way, I have a new problem to solve: there was a reason I wanted <code>cursorLocation</code> to be a property and not a function. I definitely do not want to be forced to use the <code>getPropertyName()</code> syntax all across my app. Thankfully, this can be solved, like this:</p>

<pre><code>extension CursorInput {
  var cursorLocation: CGPoint {
    get { return self.getCursorLocation() }
    set { self.setCursorLocation(newValue) }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is what is so cool about protocol extensions. Anything declared in a protocol extension behaves analogously to a default argument for a function - only used if nothing else takes precedence. Because of this different mode of behavior, this property does not cause a conflict when I conform <code>AATrackpad</code> to <code>CursorInput</code>. I can now use the property semantics that I originally wanted and I don't have to worry about namespace conflicts. I'm satisfied.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>""Wait a second - now that</strong> <code>AATrackpad</code> <strong>conforms to</strong> <code>CursorInput</code><strong>, doesn't it have two versions of</strong> <code>cursorLocation</code><strong>? If I were to use</strong> <code>trackpad.cursorLocation</code><strong>, would it be a</strong> <code>CGPoint</code> <strong>or an</strong> <code>AAPoint</code><strong>?</strong></p>

<p>The way this works is this - if within this scope the object is known to be an <code>AATrackpad</code> then Alice's original property is used:</p>

<pre><code>let trackpad = AATrackpad()
type(of: trackpad.cursorLocation) // This is AAPoint
</code></pre>

<p>However, if the type is known only to be a <code>CursorInput</code> then the default property that I defined gets used:</p>

<pre><code>let cursorInput: CursorInput = AATrackpad()
type(of: cursorInput.cursorLocation) // This is CGPoint
</code></pre>

<p>This means that if I do happen to know that the type is <code>AATrackpad</code> then I can access either version of the property like this:</p>

<pre><code>let trackpad = AATrackpad()
type(of: trackpad.cursorLocation) // This is AAPoint
type(of: (trackpad as CursorInput).cursorLocation) // This is CGPoint
</code></pre>

<p>and it also means that my use case is exactly solved, because I specifically wanted <em>not</em> to know whether my <code>cursorInput</code> happens to be an <code>AATrackpad</code> or a <code>BBMouse</code> - only that it is some kind of <code>CursorInput</code>. Therefore, wherever I am using my <code>cursorInput: CursorInput?</code>, its properties will be of the types which I defined in the protocol extension, not the original types defined in the class.</p>

<hr>

<p>There is one possibility that a protocol with only functions as requirements could cause a namespace conflict - Jonas pointed this out in his comment. If one of the protocol requirements is a function with no arguments and the conforming type already has a property with that name then the type will not be able to conform to the protocol. This is why I made sure to name my functions including verbs, not just nouns (<code>func getCursorLocation () -&gt; CGPoint</code>) - if any third-party type is using a verb in a property name then I probably don't want to be using it anyway :)</p>

The basic variable types all have a default value, a String is of zero length (<code>""""</code>) from the moment the variable is declared - it has no uninstantiated state. You can also test for vbNullString.</p>

","<vba><ms-word><requirements>","49069438","<p>As others have noted, you want to test against the null version of a string, vbNullString, and not against <code>Null</code> specifically. In addition to this, you also need to make sure your object isn't null itself. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Dim rqRequirements As ReqPro40.Requirements
Dim rqRequirement As ReqPro40.Requirement
Const eAttrValueLookup_Label = 4
Dim a As Long ' Avoid Integer since it has a strong habit of causing overflow errors.

    End If
 Next
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I haven't worked with this specific object type before, but I am fairly certain that <code>AttrValue(""MyAttreName"", eAttrValueLookup_Label)</code> is returning some kind of object. If this is the case, then the below pattern would be preferred:</p>

<pre><code>    Dim rqRequirements As ReqPro40.Requirements
    Dim rqRequirement As ReqPro40.Requirement
    Const eAttrValueLookup_Label = 4
    Dim a As Long ' Avoid Integer since it has a strong habit of causing overflow errors.
    ...

    For Each vReqKey In rqRequirements
        Set rqRequirement = rqRequirements(vReqKey)

        If Not rqRequirement Is Nothing Then
            Dim Attribute as Object ' Or whatever type it should be
            Set Attribute = rq.Requirement.AttrValue(""MyAttreName"", eAttrValueLookup)
            If Not Attribute is Nothing Then
                If Attribute.text &lt;&gt; Null Then
                    a = 1
                End If

                If Attribute.text = Null Then
                     a = 2
                End If
            End If
        End If
     Next
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, we are only ever calling upon the <code>text</code> property of the <code>Attribute</code> if we have actually set the <code>Attribute</code>. This avoids 424 errors down the line.</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to figure out what is happening in the code that is causing both if's to run, do something like this:</p>

<p><code>Debug.Print ""Attribute Text: "", Attribute.Text</code></p>

<p>This will allow you to see what your code is seeing. You can consider using breakpoints as well.</p>

<p>You could make a python script to check for <code>&lt;i class=""fa fa-check""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code> and make a txt of the default packages.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Adding another way I suggested in comments below.</p>

<p><em>Alternative method:</em>
Using online regex web services</p>

<p>Step 1: copy the html table removing for simpler regex the unnecesary tags and keeping the tr td tags like so </p>

<p><code>&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-nb-extensions-meta-config""&gt;_nb_ext_conf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;A configuration metapackage for enabling Anaconda-bundled jupyter extensions / BSD&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;</code></p>

<p>Step 2: Paste it into a regex web like <a href=""https://regexr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">regexr</a> and craft your regex, I managed to come up real quick with this one: <code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;a.+""&gt;(.+)&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\s+&lt;td&gt;.+&lt;\/td&gt;\s+&lt;td&gt;.+&lt;\/td&gt;\s+&lt;td&gt;&lt;i.+check.+&lt;\/td&gt;</code> im pretty sure it can be improved but works.</p>

<p>Step 3: get your list by specifying how you want to output your capture group: <code>$1 \n</code> $1 is your capture group and \n is newline, so you would get a list of packages like so:</p>

<p><code>alabaster 
anaconda-client 
anaconda-navigator 
anaconda-project 
asn1crypto 
astroid 
astropy

"44344719","Is it possible to certify an AI-based solution for safety-critical systems?","<p>First, I read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/409252/why-do-safety-requirements-like-to-discourage-use-of-ai"">this</a>. But I would like to expand. To summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When designing safety-critical systems a designer has to evaluate some metrics to get the confidence that the system will work as expected. It is, kind of, a mathematical proof with low enough complexity to be accessible to a human being. It has to do with accountability, reliability, auditability, etc...</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the other hand, at this point, AI is a black box that seems to work very well, but most of the times we do <strong>not</strong> have a <strong>proof</strong> of its correctness (mainly because the thing going on in the box is too complex to be analyzed), it is more like a statistical certainty:
<em>We trained the system and the system performed well for all the tests</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, some questions?</p>
<p>Q1. Do these two vague thoughts make sense nowadays?</p>
<p>Q2. Is possible to use AI for safety-critical system and be sure of its performance? Can we have certainty about the deterministic behavior of AI? Any reference?</p>
<p>Q3. I guess there are already some companies selling safety-critical systems based on AI in the automotive realm for example. How do they manage to certify their products for such a restrictive market?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>About Q1: thanks to Peter, I realized that, for example, for the automotive example, there are not requirements about total certainty. ASIL D level, the most restrictive level for automotive systems, requires only an upper bound for the probability of failure. So do other ISO26262 standards and levels. I would refine the question:</p>
<p>Q1. Is there any safety standard in system design, at any level/subcomponent, in any field/domain, that requires <strong>total</strong> certainty?</p>
<p>About Q2: Even though total certainty were not required, the question still holds.</p>
<p>About Q3: Now I understand how they would be able to achieve certification. Anyhow, any reference would be very welcome.</p>
","<machine-learning><artificial-intelligence><requirements><safety-critical>","44525842","<p>No solution or class of technology actually gets certified for safety-critical systems.   When specifying the system, hazards are identified, requirements are defined to avoid or mitigate those hazards to an appropriate level of confidence, and evidence is provided that the design and then the implementation meet those requirements.   Certification is simply sign-off that, within context of the particular system, appropriate evidence has been provided to justify a claim that the risk (product of likelihood of some event occurring, and the adverse impact if that event occurs) is acceptably low.    At most, a set of evidence is provided or developed for a particular product (in your case an AI engine) which will be analysed in the context of other system components (for which evidence also needs to be obtained or provided) and the means of assembling those components into a working system.    It is the system that will receive certification, not the technologies used to build it.  The evidence provided with a particular technology or subsystem might well be reused but it will be analysed in context of the requirements for each complete system the technology or subsystem is used in.</p>

<p>This is why some technologies are described as ""certifiable"" rather than ""certified"".   For example, some real-time operating systems (RTOS) have versions that are delivered with a pack of evidence that can be used to support acceptance of a system they are used in.   However, those operating systems are not certified for use in safety critical systems, since the evidence must be assessed in context of the overall requirements of each total system in which the RTOS is employed.</p>

<p>Formal proof is advocated to provide the required evidence for some types of system or subsystems.   Generally speaking, formal proof approaches do not scale well (complexity of the proof grows at least as fast as complexity of the system or subsystem) so approaches other than proof are often employed.  Regardless of how evidence is provided, it must be assessed in the context of requirements of the overall system being built.</p>

<p>Now, where would an AI fit into this?   If the AI is to be used to meet requirements related to mitigating or avoiding hazards, it is necessary to provide evidence that they do so appropriately in context of the total system.   If there is a failure of the AI to meet those requirements, it will be necessary for the system as a whole (or other subsystems that are affected by the failure of the AI to meet requirements) to contain or mitigate the effects, so the system as a whole meets its complete set of requirements.</p>

<p>If the presence of the AI prevents delivery of sufficient evidence that the system as a whole meets its requirements, then the AI cannot be employed.   This is equally true whether it is technically impossible to provide such evidence, or if real-world constraints prevent delivery of that evidence in context of the system being developed (e.g. constraints on available manpower, time, and other resources affecting ability to deliver the system and provide evidence it meets its requirements).</p>

<p>For a sub-system with non-deterministic behaviour, such as the learning of an AI, any inability to repeatably give results over time will make it more difficult to provide required evidence.   The more gaps there are in the evidence provided, the more it is necessary to provide evidence that OTHER parts of the system mitigate the identified hazards.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, testing on its own is considered a poor means of providing evidence.   The basic reason is that testing can only establish the presence of a deficiency against requirements (if the testing results demonstrate) but cannot provide evidence of the absence of a deficiency (i.e. a system passing all its test cases does not provide evidence about anything not tested for).    The difficulty is providing a justification that testing provides sufficient coverage of requirements.   This introduces the main obstacle to using an AI in a system with safety-related requirements - it is necessary for work at the system level to provide evidence that requirements are met, because it will  be quite expensive to provide sufficient test-based evidence with the AI.</p>

<p>One strategy that is used at the system level is partitioning.  The interaction of the AI with other sub-systems will be significantly constrained.  For example, the AI will probably not directly interact with actuators that can cause a hazard, but will instead make requests to other subsystems.   Then the burden of evidence is placed on how well the other subsystems meet requirements, including the manner they interact with actuators.   As part of providing that evidence, the other subsystems may check all the data or requests from the AI, and ignore any that would cause an inappropriate actuation (or any other breach of overall system requirements).  As a result of this, the AI itself may not actually meet any safety-related requirements at all - it might simply take information or provide information to other subsystems, and those other subsystems actually contribute more directly to meeting the overall system requirements.   Given that the developers of an AI probably cannot provide all the needed evidence, it is a fair bet that system developers will try to constrain the effects an AI - if employed - can have on behaviour of the total system.</p>

<p>Another strategy is to limit the learning opportunities for the AI.  For example, evidence will be provided with each training set - in the context of the AI itself - that the AI behaves in a predictable manner.  That evidence will need to be provided in total every time the training set is updated, and then the analysis for the system as a whole will need to be redone.   That is likely to be a significant undertaking (i.e. a long and expensive process) so the AI or its training sets will probably not be updated at a particularly high rate. </p>

A person Record always contains the types '001' and '099', representing a start- and an end Record fora person. Other records are added to a person entry based on an 'incident'. Hence a Record is built based on the given incident.</p>

<p>Example.</p>

<pre><code>000 # Start of doc.
001 # Person begin.
...
n Records (n &gt; 001 &amp;&amp; n &lt; 099)
...
099 # Person end.
001 # Person begin.
...
n Records (n &gt; 001 &amp;&amp; n &lt; 099)
...
099 # Person end.
001 # Person begin.
...
n Records (n &gt; 001 &amp;&amp; n &lt; 099)
...
099 # Person end.
999 # End of doc.
</code></pre>

<p>Apart from the Record Type on each line there are other data contained within fixed positions. </p>

<p>Example of actual start Record</p>

<pre><code>0010308952872          01000000000000 K1995-03-01
</code></pre>

<p>My approach, so far, is to define an .XSD per type of record and use schema binding classes. My problem is that there are still no requirements in regards to what types of records are relevant based on the type of incident. I would just grab a phone and call the person responsible, but working for the public sector makes planning a b****.</p>

"41246203","How to make modal box appear only after all requirements have been met?","<p>So I have a form, which asks for the user's personal information. At the end of the form I have set a modal to pop up, which says ""Thank you for signing up with us etc."". However, even if you leave all the fields blank and you click on the button at the end of the form, the modal still pop up saying ""Thank you for signing up with us..."".</p>

<p>How can I set the modal to appear only after all the fields are completed?</p>

<p>Note: I need the personal information to remain on the page after I click the button at the end of the form. I changed the type from submit to button, but as soon as I fill in the last question and i click on the button, all the input disappears.</p>

","<javascript><forms><modal-dialog><radio-button><requirements>","41248330","<p>The reason why your form is cleared is that your form is submitted to the server, and hence the page reloaded with an empty form.</p>

<p>In my opinion, there are two ways in which you could handle this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Classic form submission</li>
<li>AJAX form submission</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>In the first case</strong> you would send your form, process it on the server, and then redirect to a page containing a welcome message (the content of your modal). But in this case your form would be cleared on submission.</p>

<p><strong>In the second case</strong>, you want to do several things in the right order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Send the form data to the server by an AJAX request</li>
<li>Handle success and error cases</li>
<li>Show your modal, containing a message according to status (success or error)</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the code, in your HTML:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove <code>onsubmit=""ask()""</code> from your <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag</li>
<li>Add a <code>type=""submit""</code> attribute to your submit button</li>
<li>Add <code>style=""display:none""</code> to your <code>&lt;div id=""myModal""&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Add a <code>id=""modalText""</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag inside your modal</li>
</ol>

<p>In your script, add the following after your code (you could use jQuery to make it simpler, however this is not mandatory at all, see <a href=""http://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/ajax/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>):</p>

<pre><code>// Get &lt;form&gt; element and modal's &lt;p&gt; element
var formElem = document.getElementById('personalinfo');
var modalTextElem = document.getElementById('modalText');
var modalText;

// This replaces onsubmit=""ask()""
formElem.addEventListener(""submit"", ask);

// The e argument to ask is an Event
function ask(e) {
    // This will prevent the form from being submitted
    // (litterally ""prevent default event"" from taking place)
    e.preventDefault();

    // Send data to the server via an AJAX POST request
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // process.php would be a server-side script (see below)
    xhr.open('POST', 'process.php');

    // This is what is called a callback:
    // code that will be executed when your request returns
    xhr.onload = function() {

        // HTTP status 200 = OK
        if (xhr.status === 200) {
            var data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
            modalText = 'Thank you ' + data.firstname +
                ', for signing up with us ! You can now proceed to the test.';
        }
        // Otherwise an error occurred
        else if (xhr.status !== 200) {
            modalText = 'Request failed.  Returned status of ' + xhr.status
                + ' with error: &lt;b&gt;' + xhr.responseText + '&lt;/b&gt;';
        }
        // Set the modal text
        modalTextElem.innerHTML = modalText;
        // Show the moal
        modal.setAttribute(""display"", ""block"");
    };

    // Actually send the request
    xhr.send(new FormData(formElem));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then an example of server-side processing in PHP (<code>process.php</code> located in the same folder as your HTML form):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
function validataData() {
    if( strlen($_POST['firstname'] ) &lt; 2 ) {
        return ""first name is too short (2+ characters required)"";
    }
    if( strlen($_POST['lastname'] ) &lt; 2 ) {
        return ""last name is too short (2+ characters required)"";
    }
    return """";
}
$validationResult = validataData();

// On error send an error response (400 bad request with the type of error)
if( !empty($validationResult) ) {
    http_response_code(400);
    die($validationResult);
}

// Otherwise send back form data (by default with error code 200)
echo json_encode($_POST);
die();
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that this code is quick'n'dirty stuff, just to address your question.</p>

<p>In real-life code,you would ask an email and password in your form, then you would need much more server-side stuff: you would check that the email doesn't already exist in your database, etc.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask if anything isn't clear.</p>

","<uml><use-case><requirements>","40438246","<p>Yes, synthesizing use cases is difficult. And often people try to depict functional parts using lots of include/extend to show the system under consideration. But actually use cases are not about functionality. They are about added value. So if you sit down a moment and think which of those bubbles really represent added value, you will find that <code>Request repair service</code>, <code>Make appointment</code> and <code>Manage club</code> are real candidates while most of the others are just technical paraphernalia. <code>Manage &lt;x&gt;</code> is a bit of a borderline. I'd eventually use CRUD here, that's 4 use cases, since they are used in different contexts and often different actors. When you synthesize use cases just ask yourself: does it add value. Only if the answer is yes, add this as use case. Else you have some technical sequence of actions or even simpler a constraint (like for <code>Login</code>).</p>

<p>FYI this is node v 4.5.0</p>
","<javascript><node.js><express><mean-stack><requirements>","39985463","<p>The comments already cover the main answer, but I'll try to break it out here for a slightly more complete overview of the subject (not all encompassing). The short version is that node looks in node's core (built in) packages, then your project's <code>node_modules</code> path for modules (packages, but we generally <code>require</code> modules) matching the name. <a href=""https://docs.npmjs.com/how-npm-works/packages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></p>

<h3>Package Installation, Saving, and Location</h3>

<p>Node uses <code>npm</code> to install dependencies, which can be either a ""dependency"" or ""devDependency""; the latter is used for development concerns that shouldn't be required for just normally using the module. We save these to our project's <code>package.json</code> using the flag <code>--save</code> or <code>--save-dev</code> (such as <code>npm install express --save</code>). <a href=""https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a></p>

<p>The <code>package.json</code> file is what sits at the root of your project tree (the project's folder/directory) and contains the dependency information, along with other information. <a href=""https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3</a> This is defines a ""package"". When a person publishes a package to <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">npmjs</a>, the (default) registry for packages to install via <code>npm</code>, they should include a well formed <code>package.json</code> which lists its own dependencies, files to include, and what is the ""main"" file to start with, should it be used in a <code>require</code> statement.</p>

<p>The dependencies you install by running <code>npm install</code> after cloning down the project's repository, will install the packages specified in the <code>package.json</code>, into the <code>node_modules</code> path in the root of your project (where you should be running the install command from).</p>

Side Note

<p>After checking <a href=""https://github.com/scotch-io/starter-node-angular"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the GitHub repo</a> listed by the article you referenced, you appear to have created each of the files inside the <code>app/</code> directory.</p>

<h3>Require-ing</h3>

<p>The use of a <code>require</code> statement in node is in the style of <a href=""http://www.commonjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CommonJS</a> and for node, looks first (after core packages) in the <code>node_modules/</code> path or, if you specify a relative path to a folder or file, you can get it directly. Path relative means that it starts with <code>./</code> for a prefix to the current working directory (that the file is executing from), <code>../</code> for the directory above the current one, etc. There are other ways of handling paths, such as as the <code>path</code> module that is built into node <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/path.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">4</a>. For example, the following are valid:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>require('./some-other.js')</code> require in that file's <code>module.exports</code>, from the <code>some-other.js</code> file <a href=""https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">5</a>, in the current, relative path</li>
<li><code>require('./some.json')</code> will bring in JSON formatted content from a <code>.json</code> file <a href=""https://www.bennadel.com/blog/2908-you-can-use-require-to-load-json-javascript-object-notation-files-in-node-js.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">6</a>, in the current, relative path</li>
<li><code>require('./routes')</code> will/can also bring in exported content from the <code>routes/</code> path (directory), which will by default start with the directory's <code>index.js</code>, should it exist <a href=""https://github.com/scotch-io/starter-node-angular/blob/964c3712bdeabc6a60ce495576222ca85fb6483f/server.js#L24-L25"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">7</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That last method is a nice way to be able to bring in a more complex requirement, without keeping everything in a single, overly busy file.</p>

"39745008","Should Multiple Actors share the same Goals in Actor-Goal list","<p>Craig Larman states that creating an Actor[/User]-Goal list in form of some table/grid is a good technique for finding Use Cases during Requirements Analysis. (Applying UML and Patterns - P. 69 ff)</p>

<p>Some simple two-column table should be enough to provide a good Overview for this example; imagine following Actor-Goal List:</p>

<p><kbd><strong><code>Actor    </code></strong></kbd><kbd><strong><code>Goal                    </code></strong></kbd><br/><br/>
<kbd><code>Admin    </code></kbd><kbd><code>Create User             </code></kbd><br>
<kbd><code>  ""      </code></kbd><kbd><code>Read User               </code></kbd><br>
<kbd><code>  ""      </code></kbd><kbd><code>.. (full CRUD)          </code></kbd><br>
<kbd><code>  ""      </code></kbd><kbd><code>CRUD Entry              </code></kbd><br>
<kbd><code>  ""      </code></kbd><kbd><code>Assign Entry (to User)  </code></kbd><br>
<kbd><code>  ""      </code></kbd><kbd><code>..                      </code></kbd><br></p>

<p><kbd><code>User     </code></kbd><kbd><code>Create Entry            </code></kbd><br>
<kbd><code>  ""      </code></kbd><kbd><code>.. (full CRUD)          </code></kbd><br>
<kbd><code>  ""      </code></kbd><kbd><code>CRUD himself?           </code></kbd><br>
<kbd><code>  ""      </code></kbd><kbd><code>..                      </code></kbd><br></p>

<p><strong>Admin</strong> can do what <strong>User</strong> can + more like managing the Users of the <strong>S</strong>ystem <strong>u</strong>nder <strong>D</strong>evelopment or assigning Entries to them.</p>

<p>Admin and User clearly are sharing some Goals(Can we use the term Use Case yet?).<br><br></p>

<p>Im not really sure where to go from here in terms of refining this Actor-Goal list.</p>

<p>My brain tells me that i can spare time and effort by <strong>reusing/abstraction</strong> here, so I will most likely end up with one common superclass implementing the <strong>CRUD Entry</strong> behaviour, where Admin is extending the functionality by the <strong>Manage Goals</strong>(CRUD User, assign, etc.).<br></p>

<p>But I know that this is rather a question of Design than Analysis.<br>
I also know that I can write the Use Case for this in isolation: I dont have to state who exactly uses it, I just need to know that it's some entity which is adhering to the given contract[/interface].</p>

<p><br>
When is the time to start thinking about abstraction?
<br>Am I overcomplicating things by doing so right now?<br>
Should We leave the Actor-Goal list like above and check it off as a ""complete"" Artifact?</p>

<p>Since the classical purpose of an Actor-Goal list is to provide some quick overview for our next Artifact - the Use Case Diagram - could we begin the transition right here?:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QuEUi.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QuEUi.png"" alt=""use case diagram""></a></p>

<p>The Use Case Diagram makes the whole <strong>reusing</strong> part much more visible (at least to me). Would it be advisable to adopt the redundancy right now and take care of it during later stages (e.g. design)?
<br><br>
Appreciate your input!</p>

<p><br>
<strong>EDIT</strong>: Also I'm not quite sure about the User CRUDing himself.. But lets keep things simple and stick to the main question.</p>
","<uml><use-case><requirements><ooad>","41387831","<p>It's an excellent idea to identify the candidate use cases in an actor-goal list, as you have described.  </p>

<p><strong>The issues when identifying use cases</strong></p>

<p>In the real life, you'll quickly encounter consistency issues when elaborating the list during requirement elicitation : </p>

<ul>
<li><p>some interviewed users/business experts will describe very detailed step by step goals (corresponding to system functions), whereas other will describe rather high level goals user goals.  So you'll need a third column to identify the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cockburnstyle_use_cases.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">goal level</a> of each use case.   </p></li>
<li><p>terminology and user goals will not always be expressed in an homogeneous way.  So cross checking, and renaming of use cases might be required.  For example, I had a system where:</p>

<ul>
<li>an admin claimed to <code>manage authorizations</code>, and a business user claimed to <code>manage authorization</code>.  Was it the same use case ?  No:  it appeared that the first <code>maintained assignment of authorizations</code> in the system and the second was empowered to <code>decide on authorizations assignment and request them</code> from the admin. </li>
<li>a purchaser explained that for a purchase order someone has to <code>register a good receipt</code> before the invoice is paid.  The warehouse clerk explained that at warehouse they <code>manage stock movement</code>.  Latter, though, it appeared, that those movements where good receipts, good issues, and stock transfers.  </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So a fourth column for comments about main variants could help to keep the overview, and to spot hidden sharing potential.  </p>

<p>There is generally a great deal of cross checking and harmonization to be done before sharing/reusing use cases.  Reusing too quickly might end up loosing more time than expected.   </p>

<p><strong>The use case diagramming</strong></p>

<p>I will now be very provocative: once you have the nice and consistent table with all the actors and use cases, what will be the benefit that you expect from a use case diagram ?  </p>

<p>It is generally recommended <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38419273/3723423"">not to abuse use case diagrams for functional decomposition</a> (see <a href=""http://epf.eclipse.org/wikis/openup/practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.base/guidances/guidelines/use_case_model_4C64E97D.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">also here</a>). So the use case diagram will add little more to what you already have in the list. </p>

<p>In addition,  <code>&lt;&lt;Include&gt;&gt;</code> , <code>&lt;&lt;Extend&gt;&gt;</code> and generalization relations should be used scarcely because they tend to quickly make the diagram difficult to understand. </p>

<p>Finally, does abstraction and reuse really happen at the level of the use case ? Is this relevant to the actors outside of the system ? If not, it's more about design and implementation details.  So I'd suggest to consider these more in the class model that you will create (or derive) to implement the use cases.      </p>

<p><strong>Does PHP has any hardware or system requirements?</strong> </p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<php><server><updates><requirements>","37983222","<p>PHP doesn't have any hardware limitations I've ever encountered, but one thing that will certainly stop you from compiling newer versions of PHP on older *nix systems is software.</p>

<p>Modern versions of PHP won't compile on older *nix systems because they don't have the required tools to build PHP (a modern C compiler, semi-recent versions of glibc, GNU make, Bison, and a lot of the PHP extensions will have prerequisites of newer library versions that are incompatible with the ones installed on older systems).</p>

<p>That might very well be why they're saying that.  I've tried to compile PHP 5.4 on RedHat 7.3 without much luck because all those system libraries and tools for compiling software are too old.  With the OpenSSL extension, old systems often don't even have the right header files with function prototypes PHP is expecting during compilation.</p>

<p>So yes, compiling PHP is difficult or impossible on an older system (ever tried building newer versions of libc on old machines??? It's a nightmare!).</p>

<p>For example, I took PHP 5.6.22 and started to compile on Red Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) and didn't get very far...</p>

<p>First simple error:</p>

<pre><code>checking for zlib version &gt;= 1.2.0.4... 1.1.4
configure: error: libz version greater or equal to 1.2.0.4 required
</code></pre>

<p>That's easy enough to compile by itself, but a number of other libraries for extensions I wanted aren't installed on the system, and trying to compile each one might be a rabbit hole of its own.</p>

<p>So I took out the ones that we didn't have to begin with, was able to <code>./configure</code> just fine, but not too far into <code>make</code>...</p>

<pre><code>php-5.6.22/ext/openssl/openssl.c: In function `php_openssl_get_stream_from_ssl_handle':
php-5.6.22/ext/openssl/openssl.c:581: warning: passing arg 1 of `SSL_get_ex_data' discards qualifiers from pointer target type

php-5.6.22/ext/openssl/openssl.c:5112: void value not ignored as it ought to be
make: *** [ext/openssl/openssl.lo] Error 1
</code></pre>

<p>So with OpenSSL it was game over (it's version 0.9.6b by the way, so old!).  I could probably compile newer OpenSSL as I've done before without trouble, but this 7.3 system is also special.  We've put a lot of effort into bringing newer versions of unsupported software (libs &amp; compiler) to this system to keep it alive, but on older ones I've had far less luck.</p>

<p>So yeah it might take days to get newer PHP going on older systems and this assumes lots of experience and knowledge on how to build and install libraries outside of your library path (so they don't interfere with other things on the system) and then get the new stuff to dynamically link to those).</p>

<p>If we don't count storage (I already have my own block storage, which I can use with Cinder and some 3rd party plugins/modules) and compute nodes (everything that's left over will become compute nodes), can I run all this on one machine? With a hot standby/failover?</p>

<p>Everything is going to be connected to the same power jack, same rack, same [outgoing] network cable so more redundancy that that is overkill. I don't even need that, but ""why not"" :)</p>

<p>The basic recommendation I've heard is four to six machines. And after a lot of pestering the ones who said that, it turns out that ""two storage, two controller, two compute"". Which, is what I was thinking as well: Running this on two machines should be enough. They're basically only going to run Glance, Horizon and Cinder. And possibly Neutron and Keystone.</p>

<p>Neither of them seems to be very resource-heavy.</p>

<p>Is there something I'm missing?</p>

<p>Oh, and nothing of this is going to face the 'Net! It's all just for me.</p>
","<hardware><openstack><requirements>","36634856","<p>Though it is theoretically possible to bring up OpenStack without Keystone, it is almost practically impossible and makes the system pretty inconvenient to use.</p>

Based on the feedback the team gets they either carry on as before or they may adapt. For example they may take the feedback and add it as new user stories to the backlog and prioritise them against the existing stories. This differs from the prototype approach in that we try to have production-ready working software at the end of each iteration.</p>

<p>If you are interested in using this agile approach I would highly recommend reading 'Agile Estimating and Planning' by Mike Cohn.</p>

<p>That's a specification.</p>

<p>It's not a very useful one, because it doesn't give many guarantees to the user of an implementation of that specification. If I wanted to write a program that adds two integers, I couldn't do it just from reading the specification.</p>

<p>It <em>does</em> give the <em>implementor</em> a lot of freedom, though. Generally, you want your specification to be <em>precise</em> in the points that matter to the <em>user</em>, but <em>vague</em> in the points that matter to the <em>implementor</em>. That way, the user gets the guarantees he needs to be able to write his programs, but it also gives the implementor the freedom to tailor his implementation to his particular niche.</p>

<p>For example, the Java Language Specification doesn't say anything about Garbage Collection. It only defines when objects are and aren't reachable, and it defines that you can create new objects. How the memory allocation works, how the garbage collector works, whether it is a reference-counting, tracing, or region-based collector, etc. all of those are left out, and thus different implementations for different niches can use different garbage collector implementations, and different implementations for the same niche can compete with each other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>or, do I have to create a document something like:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>JMA must provide the method: int jmaAdd(int x,int y)?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>That's also a specification. It is even less useful than the one above. It <em>does</em> define the name of the method, but it doesn't define what it does.</p>

<pre><code>int jmaAdd(int x, int y) { return x - y; }
</code></pre>

<p>is a perfectly valid implementation of that specification, as is </p>

<pre><code>int jmaAdd(int x, int y) { return 0; }
</code></pre>

<p>Again, there are no guarantees for the user and too much leeway (or more precisely: leeway in the wrong areas) for the implementor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>or, do I have to create the interfaces and distrubute the source code?</p>

<pre><code>public interface JMA{
    int jmaAdd(int x,int y);
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn't necessarily call that a specification. That's code, and thus an implementation.</p>

<p>Note: of course, in Java, <code>interface</code>s provide <em>specification</em> of behavior that <code>class</code>es then <em>implement</em>. But that's <em>not</em> what is meant by the term <em>specification</em> the way you used it in your question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>or do I have to compile  the interfaces and publish it as jar? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, that's an implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, can a specification contain abstract classes or classes at all? Or must it consist only of interfaces?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A specification doesn't contain anything. It's a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Typically, specifications are written in English. Well, actually, they are written in a specialized specification-writing language, which is often a highly stylized formal subset of English with specific semantics. For example, <a href=""https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt"">BCP14/RFC2119: Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels</a> defines the precise meaning of some common English words in relation to IETF standards documents. (Interestingly, it is also a specification, thus making it a specification for writing specifications.)</p>

<p>Formal Logic is also sometimes used, especially in Programming Language specifications to describe typing rules. And sometimes, even specialized Formal Specification Languages are used, like the <a href=""http://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/mike/zrm/zrm.pdf"">Z Notation</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What makes a specification, a specification?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simple and not very satisfying answer is that a specification is a specification if it is called a specification by people who care about specifications. (Or more generally: <em>thought about</em> as a specification.)</p>

<p>Different communities have different views on specifications. And different names for them.</p>

<p>For example, the original specification for the <a href=""/questions/tagged/scheme"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;scheme&#39;"" rel=""tag"">scheme</a> programming language was simply published in a scientific report. Then after a few rounds of improvements and new reports, they published the ""Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme"". And after that the ""Revised Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme"". With that began a kind of in-joke, and the current version of the language is defined in the ""Revised Revised Revised Revised Revised Revised Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme"", commonly written the ""Revised<sup>7</sup> Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme"" or just ""<a href=""http://r7rs.org/"">R<sup>7</sup>RS</a>"".</p>

<p>None of those reports is called a ""specification"", yet every single one is a specification. Before Scheme, ALGOL also used the term ""Report"", as did several other languages.</p>

<p>Internet RFCs are also a good example. Technically, all an RFC is, is a ""Request for Comments"". Only very few of those RFCs are actually elevated to ""Standards"" status. Some are also ""Best Current Practices"". None of them are called ""Specification"", but many of them are treated that way. For example, HTTP is not a standard, but it is treated as both a standard and a specification, and significant portions of our new world economy are built on that.</p>

<p>If you want to get a feel for specifications, it's probably best if you just read some:</p>

","<requirements><system-requirements>","34406246","<p>It is neither. ""The development of a RESTful API in JSON"" is not a requirement, but just describes the process of implementing one or more underlying requirements.</p>

<p><strong>But you probably refer to a functional requirement.</strong></p>

<p>You should always seek to split requirements, which describe a function or quality that the future system shall have, from their technical implementation.</p>

<p>Such a functional requirement could be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(identifier 1) The system under development must offer the following
  information to external systems via an interface: (table of required
  information)</p>

<p>Then you can break that down further into more detailed functional requirements, one of which can be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(identifier 2) The system under development must offer its
  information specified in (<em>reference to identifier 1</em>) to external
  systems in the JSON format via an interface that is accessible for
  REST clients, in order to feed <em>external system XYZ</em>.</p>

<p>Nonfunctional requirements, in contrast, tell more details about the API qualities. Such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance </li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Maintainability</li>
<li>Portability</li>

  <p>... do you need both use cases and functional requirements or just one ...</p>

<p>The difference is only in approach if one were to close-read the primary authors of these techniques. </p>

<p>Use cases approach is considered a more efficient means of collecting essential requirements, whereas functional requirements approach ensures a complete specification that can then filter out redundancies, overlaps, and unwanted features.</p>

<p>Use cases approach takes into account at the outset external actors (users, processes, agents, etc.) and how they interface with the system, whereas the functional requirements approach the problem from a solution angle (how can we employ this feature to solve our problem?)</p>

<p>Use cases capture actors, users, methods, domain knowledge, unique techniques, etc. Use cases can lead to complete packaged solutions. Functional approach capture product categories, product variants, market differentiations. Functional approach can help develop finely tuned release strategies where functionality is developed and layered over previous releases.</p>

<p>Another way to describe is that use cases is more an user-oriented spec and functional approach is a developer spec. From a language and communication perspective, it is said that use cases approach leads to easier to understand documentation that is already cast in the end-users' language idioms. On the other hand, functional approach is what makes the system complete and integrated whole. </p>

<p>In modern SRS, both perspectives are essential for a complete, useful system. Ideally, one has to map to the other. Benefits of both approaches cannot be discounted no matter where one starts the process. </p>

<p>Functional requirements are a set of requirements, mostly in text form that defines the system functionality being developed. Use case diagram is requirements elicitation of a software system. 
Both can be used and there are clear advantages in doing so. The functional requirements can easily be used as unit test cases, whereas the use cases can be used for user acceptance and integration tests.
Depending on the level of detail use case diagrams can also be used for unit tests.</p>

<p>From a historical perspective functional requirements was used before UML became a standard in object oriented software development. Hence these days use cases are the preferred method for capturing a systems functional requirements, if both are not to be used.</p>

<p>The main difference is that use case diagrams are a graphical representation of the systems requirements, whereas functional requirements are in text form.

<p>So in my opinion they are not different levels of abstraction as much as they belong to different realms.

"30891674","TFS work item type for requirements management targeting multiple platforms","<p>In my company we are using TFS for projects targeting multiple platforms (Web, iOS, Android), and since we work on sensitive/regulated projects we have a lot of requirements to produce for each little detail of our softwares/algorithms.</p>

<p>The problems comes when we have requirements that are shared on multiple platforms (a common algorithm for example) and for that we found 2 solutions: either we duplicate the requirements for each platform, or we create additional columns on the requirement itself (like the state column which is duplicated for each platform for example..).</p>

<p>With the first solution it becomes hard to maintain requirements (mostly when you have thousands of entries..) and with the 2nd solution we get a really ugly template, that needs to change when a new platform is targeted and traceability with tests cases is not that good...</p>

<p>So I was wondering if there is a ""known/official"" solution for theses cases. When I looked at the test case work item type, I noticed that there's the notion of ""test point"" that represents the test case for a given ""test configuration"", so maybe the solution is to create a new work item type that would represent the platform (and store the state on the given platform for example).</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm taking any advice/suggestion on that topic :)</p>
","<tfs><requirements><tfs-workitem>","30897101","<p>Tagging was specifically designed to solve just this sorry of issue. In TFS 2013 you can add tags to work items and query based on those tags. If you are running your Test Cases in multiple environments it is bad practice to have duplicate test cases. You should instead use the ""Configuration"" function that can be applied to each of your Test Cases, blanket, or specific. This allows you to have a single Test Cases that has been passed in iOS but not passed on Android or WP. You can even remove configurations for features that are specific only to a single PBI.</p>

<p>In TFS 2015 you will be able to have the tags display on the cards in the kanban views.</p>

<p>Do I put those parts in <em>Non functional needs</em> ? </p>
","<specifications><requirements>","29031013","<p>This question (and my answer) is a rather subjective one as people can have different opinions and there is no true accepted standard here but I try to explain my reasoning nevertheless.</p>

<p>The required (or implemented) data format is definitely a functional requirement as it defines how your application communicates with others. The other requirements are traditionally considered non-functional but in practivce, you can get bit philosophical here as there is no One True Answer.</p>

<p>Traditionally, things like performance, security or the look of an application were considered non-functional requirements and were thus effectively demoted to the afterthoughts or nice-to-haves.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this is fundamentally wrong. By extension, I think this distinction is flawed and should not be made in the first place. Depending on your application, different things (or features) are more important than others but often, the traditionally non-functional requirements can make or break an application.</p>

<p>For example, a messaging system can look as nice as it can, if it is not secure and leaks messages, it is useless. Similarly, a computer game that is fast and secure but doesn't look nice and isn't easy to understand will probably not worth much (there are exceptions). Thus, traditionally non-functional requirements can be very well an important part of the provided functionality.</p>

<p>The best example is this very website where you are asking your question. The prime non-functional requirement is performance. It is generally considered nice to have, not not planned into the product and not considered a core-functionality. On Stack Overflow (and other stack exchange sites), performance is considered one of the main features and the developers consider a slow page to not be functional.</p>

<p>Another example is in the UI/UX space. Commonly, you considered the behaviour of a user interface (the function) separate from the look (the non-function). But if you look at e.g. smartphone apps or web apps, you will often find that the user experience is defined by both the exact behaviour and the design which can't be separated as both are strongly connected and significantly affect each other.</p>

<p>Thus, for my conclusion: You should think about your actual requirements in terms of what you want your application to provide. The distinction between functional and non-functional is rather useless as it doesn't help you to define what is important and what not. Instead, focus on your values and define the user experience you want to provide (both to end-users as well as developers, administrators, ...)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>However I would like to add a few notes. </p>

<p>The distinction between functional and non-functional test sometimes is useful. The performance and security testing domains are different from the functional testing domain. These non-functional tests usually included in the special test discipline and require different technical skills and sometimes organized in the different teams. For example performance test requires knowledge in the performance tests tools and techniques(like JMeter or/and CPU and memory profilers). The security test also is big domain itself and includes knowledge about the threat modeling and penetration testing.</p>

<p>Also I would distinct between rude bugs in performance and security that have influence on the product functionality and performance and security testing that allow to understand the product level in these areas. For example the performance test launched every build may indicate some performance product degradation (even in 10 ms) that usually not measurable in the functional testing.</p>

<p>""As a user I want to be able to access the ABC application online rather than having to install it locally because that allows me to work in a more productive way""</p>

<p>Now that sounds like a mighty big story (or even an epic). So perhaps the next stage is to break it down. Perhaps a time-boxed spike to investigate the existing application and derive some key features. These can then be converted in to stories, for example:</p>

<p>""As a user I want to be able to upload my data set so that it can be processed""</p>

<p>""As a user I want to be able to run an XYZ analysis on the data set so that I can work out the factor X value""</p>

<p>At this stage the team can make a start and work towards producing the first shippable product. Engaging with the customer to make sure that what is being built meets their requirements (rather than simply replicates the previous application).</p>

<p>The intention would be to produce the most valuable features first and to make them in to a workable product at the earliest possible opportunity. This is preferable to spending lots of time extracting requirements from the legacy application and so having a long time before the customer gets to see anything.</p>

"28530127","Can a single use case be partially implemented, or implemented over several phases? How to track & prioritize components?","<p>My requirements experience has been primarily with user stories, not use cases. I've been recently added to a project as a product owner, and the customer is ~80% done with the use cases. Many of the use cases include what would be over a dozen user stories, and the team is discussing how to implement some of the use cases over multiple phases, or how to partially implement to meet schedule. This wouldn't be a problem with stories, but I'm not sure the best way to approach with use cases.</p>

<p>Can a use case ever be partially implemented? Or would that mean that it should be decomposed into smaller use cases with extends/includes? If it can be partially implemented, how do you track individual features so high-priority items do not get lost?</p>

<p>For example, if I have a single use case for a spell checker with the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Identifying potentially mis-spelt words</li>
<li>Visually identifying misspelt words as the user types</li>
<li>Autocorrecting commonly misspelt words as the user types</li>

<li>Providing the user the ability to mass-correct misspellings</li>
<li>Allowing the user to ignore potential misspellings once</li>
<li>Allowing the user to add words to the dictionary</li>
</ol>

<p>How would I go about prioritizing the individual features and then tracking implementation of features 1 and 4 in one phase, 2, 3, 6 in second, 5 in a third, and not implementing 7? In this example, should these be separate use cases, or one with multiple alternative flows?</p>

<p>Yes, you can split up use cases with include / extend. That makes a lot of sense when you show how they decompose. You can also draw use case generalizations.</p>

<p>For keeping track of implementation stages, it is probably best to put your complete UML model under version control (some UML tools come with support for version control) and have different versions of the same diagram.</p>

<p>You might also use e.g. different colors to indicate implementation stages.  But then don't forget to create a corresponding legend and keep this updated. Also don't show future use cases to lots of people at random. The temptation to do unneccessary work prematurely might be high (remember YAGNI).</p>

<h1>Update: September 2016</h1>

<p>I no longer use <code>requirements.txt</code> (see original answer below) for installing development only packages. The prevailing wisdom seems to be that <code>requirements.txt</code> should be used to pin deployments to specific version numbers, typically using <code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code>. This ensures that the exact same versions of your project's dependencies and also your project's dependencies' dependencies are installed on all of your servers.</p>

<p>I instead use the <code>extras_require</code> option to <code>setup</code>.</p>

<pre><code>requirements = [
    'click',
    'ansible',
    'fabric',
    'gitpython',
    'pyyaml',
    'jinja2',
    'yapsy'
]

setup({
    install_requires=requirements,
    extras_require={
        'dev': [
            'pytest',
            'pytest-pep8',
            'pytest-cov'
        ]
    }
})
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to install your package for development, you run <code>pip install -e .[dev]</code>. This installs all the regular required packages <strong>and</strong> those listed in the <code>dev</code> section of <code>extras_require</code>.</p>

<p>Production installs can still be done with <code>python setup.py install</code> or <code>pip install .</code> (or with a <code>requirements.txt</code> file).</p>

<h1>Original Answer</h1>

<p>Here is <em>a</em> way to do it that seems to be in keeping with the recommendations I've run into regarding <code>setup.py</code> vs <code>requirements.txt</code>. Specify all your production dependencies in the <code>install_requires</code> parameter of <code>setup.py</code>.</p>

<pre><code>requirements = [
    'click',
    'ansible',
    'fabric',
    'gitpython',
    'pyyaml',
    'jinja2',
    'yapsy'
]

setup({
    # ...
    install_requires=requirements
    # ...
})
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file that instructs pip to install your production dependencies from <code>setup.py</code> as well as your testing dependencies.</p>

<pre><code>-e .

pytest
pytest-pep8
pytest-cov
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can install your package for development with <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. The <code>-e .</code> line will install your package and its dependencies from <code>setup.py</code> in development mode. To install on production, you could use <code>python setup.py install</code> or <code>pip install .</code>. This will only install the dependencies listed in <code>setup.py</code>.</p>

","<cordova><osx-lion><xcode4.5><requirements>","27825306","<p>It is generally a good idea to have the latest version in use when you have no other restrictions. For that reason, I would recommend you to follow <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/15417752/1744702"">these steps</a> provided by user <em>jjn</em>. I do not think you need to upgrade your hardware nor the OS X for this purpose since working with Cordova doesn't require that much of computation power.</p>

So my question is... Is there a reason why some developers would choose this? </p>

<p>The only reasons I could think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>They are sheep (Seen it required somewhere else and just copied the trend)</li>
<li>Some just implement it because that's the little regex they know</li>
<li>Just to create a false sense of security for their clients</li>
</ul>

<p>(Asking because I'm developing an app to manage user passwords and thinking to alert the users that if the website asks for that, they should not trust their security)</p>
","<security><passwords><requirements>","27546815","<p>Regarding security there is no reason such a password requirement makes sense, you already gave the answer yourself. I do not think that giving out a warning is necessary though, because the implementation is not necessarily an unsecure one.</p>

<p>In my opinion the only reasonable restriction for passwords is a minimum length. Other requirements can interfere with good password schemes and can actually reduce the strength of passwords, because users will switch to weaker passwords like ""Password2014"".</p>

You'll probably find out by testing with different hardware setups.
As you'll need to test Android apps with various devices anyway, that should not be a big deal.
We can't know the font size and neither can we estimate the complexity of your algorithms. Also I assume that the font(s) which you use has an important influence, depending on the distinctness of their chars rendering.
Plus, if the image is blurred, that'll negatively influence the resources you need.</p>

","<angularjs><angularjs-directive>","27049521","<p>The first problem is due to the fact that <code>on</code> is a jqLite/jQuery method and does not trigger the digest loop for you. This means that the UI will not be updated to reflect the changes to the model.</p>

<p>You either need to wrap the code that affects the model in a call to <code>$apply</code> or use <code>$timeout</code> instead of <code>setTimeout</code>.</p>

<p>With <code>$apply</code>:</p>

<pre><code>timer = setTimeout(function() {
  scope.$apply(fn(scope, {
    $event: event
  }));
  clicks = 0;
}, delay);

<p>With <code>$timeout</code>:</p>

        $event: event

    }, delay);
  } else {
    $timeout.cancel(timer); //prevent single-click action
    clicks = 0; //after action performed, reset counter

<p>The second issue is the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var setter = ctrl.$setViewValue;

ctrl.$setViewValue = function() {
    setter.apply(this, arguments);
    styleChange();
};
</code></pre>

<p>After calling <code>$setViewValue</code> the internal ngModelWatch will not detect the change and update the ngModel in your directive until later when the digest loop runs. Currently <code>styleChange</code> runs before this happens.</p>

<p>To run <code>styleChange</code> after the digest loop has finished you can use <code>$timeout</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ctrl.$setViewValue = function() {
  setter.apply(this, arguments);
  $timeout(styleChange);
};

<p>In our place, often times software requirements are specified in terms of complex sequence diagrams which are difficult to review, verify for correctness and make changes. Also IMHO, programmers would prefer to implement from an unambiguous text representation of the requirements,  rather than from sprawling multi page diagrams. </p>
","<uml><requirements>","26731538","<p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Yes</strong>, there is a proprietary almost formal text format language able to express information in UML sequence diagrams understandable by programmers (and may be also by some other humans).</p>
<p>The language I mean was designed and implemented by <a href=""http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steve Hanov</a>, comprehensive list of examples is available at <a href=""https://www.websequencediagrams.com/examples.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.websequencediagrams.com/examples.html</a> and I have emphasized one of the examples below so that you can get the readability idea:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7lZ5N.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<p><strong>(2) But,</strong> beware that you (or someone else) can write bad, unreadable, code in any language (textual or graphical) and changing the language will not automatically change your (or someone else's) habit's an make the code automatically better, more readable, more maintainable</p>
<p><strong>(2.1)</strong> Writing down &quot;<em>unambiguous text representation of the requirements</em>&quot;, e.g. in the form of use cases approved by the client is not an easy to-do nor easy to-learn thing and just a language change will not improve it much. (see e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24040528/from-user-stories-to-sequence-diagram"">Stack Overflow: From user stories to sequence diagram</a> for some more pointers)</p>
<p><strong>(2.2)</strong> intended audience (readers) for the UML sequence diagrams are not only programmers but also less technical stakeholders for whom a picture may be worth thousands of words . In my opinion, giving programmers Java pseudo code which can be even reverse-engineered into UML sequence diagram by a tool if needed (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17311797/how-to-generate-sequence-diagram-from-java-source-code"">Stack Overflow: how to generate sequence diagram from Java source code</a> or Google: &quot;java sequence diagram&quot; for some more pointers) is better then trying to find/invent a sequence-diagram-specific language</p>
<p><strong>(2.3)</strong> there are certainly tools that aid reading large UML designs by using tricks like zooming, hyperlinks, collapsing/expanding blocks, tuning the displayed level of detail and there are paper sizes like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216#A_series"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A3 or A2</a> which can turn typical multi-page diagram into single-page diagram</p>

","<uml><requirements>","26804091","<p>xmojmr's approach is an effective way of documenting use case scenarios, and if your sequence diagrams are confusing, it's probably because they aren't adequately documented.  As xmojmr says, a picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes a few hundred words really help to explain the picture!  I'd like to share a bit of background that you might find helpful.</p>

<p>I see the process of describing requirements as having three levels, of which use case scenarios are the third.  Top level is a use case diagram, which shows how the different use cases in a system and the stakeholders using the system interact.  Next level is the details of each of those use cases.  I use a ""use case narrative"" for this.  Third level is each individual path (""use case scenario"") through a use case.</p>

<p>There is a lot of confusion out there between levels two and three.  This is partly because to some extent they run together, for example it's reasonable to analyze related success and failure paths through a use case as one scenario rather than two.  At least, I prefer to treat them as one scenario.</p>

<p>I prefer to use activity diagrams to document use case narratives.  While you can pretty much do anything with a sequence diagram (at least the 2.0 version), IMO divergent behaviors, decision trees, and parallel behaviors are more obvious in activity diagrams than in sequence diagrams.  So, one activity diagram per use case, and then one sequence diagram for each separate scenario in the use case.  </p>

<p>In your process, it looks like sequence diagrams are not accompanied by formal use case scenario documentation.  If you google ""use case scenario"" you will find a number of examples of such.  However, keep in mind that a lot of the examples are actually documenting what I'm calling ""narratives"".  </p>

<p>I'm using the terminology in Tom Pender's <em>The UML Bible</em> (Wiley Publishing, 2003).  Another great book is Alistair Cockburn's <em>Writing Effective Use Cases</em>: <a href=""http://alistair.cockburn.us/get/2465"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> is a good-sized sample.</p>

<li>it can be broken up into chapters and sections</li>
<li>Images can be added to requirement document.</li>
<li>Paragraphs introducing the chapter can be added.</li>

<li>Requirement Number (1 to 4 digit integer)</li>
<li>Depends on (Line above)</li>
<li>Requirement Name</li>
<li>Class (4 to 10 chars)</li>
<li>Priority (required or optional)</li>
<li>Requirement string</li>

<p>So I have tried to do the following which works ok in markdown</p>

<pre><code>Req  | Belongs |    Name         | Class | Priority
-----|---------|-----------------|-------|---------
1209 | 1208    | File Delimiters | sysrs | required

Each file is enclosed in curly braces ``{}''.

<p>But i do not like to always having to adjust the spacing in ""name field"" when the name length changes.  So I tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>---
** 1209 ** &gt;&gt;&gt; 1208, File Delimiters, sysrs, required

Each file is enclosed in curly braces ``{}''.
___
</code></pre>

<p>But it is little hard to read.  So I would love to make it like this:</p>

<pre><code>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each file is enclosed in curly braces ``{}''.

"24786769","Real world example where event capturing is necessary / preferred?","<p>The <code>addEventListener</code> DOM method supports a third optional, boolean parameter (useCapture) to indicate whether the function should use event <strong>bubbling</strong> or event <strong>capturing</strong> as propagation method. In <a href=""http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> the difference is nicely shown (click on the examples &amp; view code).</p>

<p>From other questions on SO and blog posts, I concluded event bubbling was preferred mostly because IE8- didn't support it. </p>

<p>Suppose I'm only required to support IE9+, in what situation would event capturing be necessary or preferred over event bubbling? In other words, in what situation would it be better to let the events execute on the outermost elements first, and then the innermost elements? I'm looking for a simple, real world example to demonstrate the use of event capturing...</p>
","<javascript><requirements><dom-events><event-propagation><event-capturing>","40820226","<p>Event capturing used to be the only option outside of the Internet Explorer browser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the major differences of the back then two important browsers was how they handled events. Microsoft worked with the bubbling phase - meaning the event first hit on the target element and then traverse the whole DOM upwards hitting on the parent nodes whereas Netscape did it the exact other way - meaning the event first passes the parent elements and then runs down to the target element - capturing. This caused developers in the early days a lot of trouble and the W3C finally specified an approach where both kind of works and can be used at free will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Event capturing is useful in event delegation when bubbling is not supported. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some events, such as focus, don't bubble but can be captured.
The inline handler on the target element triggers before capture handlers for the target element.</p>
<p>Many newly specified events in the web platform (such as the media events) do not bubble, which is a problem for frameworks like Ember that rely on event delegation. However, the capture API, which was added in IE9, is invoked properly for all events, and does not require a normalization layer. Not only would supporting the capture API allow us to drop the jQuery dependency, but it would allow us to properly handle these non-bubbling events. This would allow you to use events like playing in your components without having to manually set up event listeners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Custom events and bubbling have the following issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently, Ember relies on jQuery for event handling, doing so comes with several costs:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>jQuery silently changes inline handlers to bubble handlers.
    This changes expected invocation order
    This can cause automated tests to fail
Events triggered via jQuery.trigger trigger handlers in a different order than events triggered by a user.
    This changes expected invocation order
    This leads to difficult to reason about and debug aberrations in behavior
    This often causes automated tests to fail
Events must flow down and bubble back up through the entire DOM before being detected by the Ember application, and then must undergo an expensive delegation process that is effectively re-bubbling to find the right handler.
Handlers attached directly within components or by non-ember plugins take precedent over handlers attached by Ember, whether this was desired or not.

    This causes component handlers to have far-reaching side-effects
    This leads to difficult to reason about and debug aberrations in behavior
    This often causes automated tests to fail
</code></pre>
<p>A media player focus=&gt;play preprocess/postprocess event flow would be a simple use case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mechanics of the capturing phase make it ideal for preparing or preventing behavior that will later be applied by event delegation during the bubbling phase. And that’s how we’re going to use it here—to initialize the sortable in response to a mouse click, but just before the event starts bubbling and other handlers have a chance to deal with it.</p>
<p>To make use of capturing, we have to go down to the metal. jQuery’s event methods only work for bubbling and don’t let us tap into the capturing phase. The capturing handler looks like:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    document.addEventListener(&quot;mousedown&quot;, function(event) {
      if ($(event.target).closest(&quot;.sortable_handle&quot;).length) {

<p>Are the included and extending use cases make sense?</p>
","<requirements>","23971680","<p>Basically yes, depending on what you are willing to achieve.</p>

<p><strong>Include</strong> simply means that the included use case cannot exist on it's own and needs to by part of the use case, for which it is included and at the same time the basis use case won't be complete without the successful included use case.</p>

<p>This translated for your use case scenario will mean:
In order the user (write a name for the actor) to log in, he has to enter his User id, enter his password, the system has to parse the id and the password and display the main screen.</p>

<p><strong>Extends</strong> can optionally add some other steps to the main functionality, in this case to the log in, which means that it's optional to display an incorrect log in screen (somehow verbose in your scenario). This will also mean that <code>Display Login screen</code> is also optional, which IMO is not the case and it has to be included in the main use case, but this is relative to what you are willing to achieve.</p>

<p><strong>Advice:</strong> Learn the exact UML specification. You need to write the name of the actors, to write down <code>&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt;</code> and to define a system.

"23895969","Manage TFS ""Affected by"" Links for many Work Items","<p>I love being able to manage Parent-Child TFS Links in Excel with the ""Open Query in Microsoft Exel"" button in Visual Studio.  I can create a Parent-Child relationship between two work items in Excel by cutting the child row, pasting it under the parent row and then indenting the child row.  When I hit the Publish button in Excel, all the Links are created in TFS between the modified Work Items.</p>

<p>Now I want to try this with other Link types, specifically Affects-Affected By.  The problem is that in TFS, the Parent-Child Links are the only hierarchical links available, so those are the only Links that work with the Indent-Outdent buttons in Excel.</p>

<p>I have a TON of Requirements that need to be mapped to Features with the Affects-Affected By Links and I really do not want to open each Work Item in TFS, go to the All Links tab, create a new Link, forget the ID, cancel out of the dialog, look up the ID again, go back to Work Item, create the Link, click OK, save the Work Item and then repeat this 3000 to 4000 more times.</p>

<p>I looked at Telerik's free tool ""TFS Work Item Manager"" (<a href=""http://www.telerik.com/teampulse/tfs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telerik.com/teampulse/tfs</a>) because I thought the Task Board screen might offer drag-and-drop Work Item association capability but I couldn't find anything that helped.</p>

<p>Is there a way to associate Work Items of different types (in my case Requirements and Features) with Affects or Affected By Links in a nicer UI like Excel or Telerik's tool that is more accommodating?</p>
","<tfs><requirements><tfs-workitem><traceability>","43943437","<p>I don't think this functionality exists in Excel. The closest that exists is the ""Links &amp; Attachements"" column, which is useless - basically a boolean that is ""Yes"" if either exist.</p>

"23805681","UML use case diagram server as system actor and which kind of use cases","<p>I´m creating an use case diagram based on the following scenario:</p>

<p>There is a mobile application which passes data to an webserver/database. The webserver on the other hand sends data to the mobile application. </p>

<p>So i have two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Data send to the application is individual data only for this smartphone/user. So does it make sense to show server/database as an external system actor which gets connected with the specific use cases?</p></li>
<li><p>Are use cases (for the mobile app) like ""showing information about something"" oder ""refresh data"" necessary? Because i think they are not necessary for the business logic. What do you think?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for ideas!</p>
","<mobile><uml><requirements><use-case>","23806939","<blockquote>
  <p>Data send to the application is individual data only for this
  smartphone/user. So does it make sense to show server/database as an
  external system actor which gets connected with the specific use
  cases?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if the server/database is <em>really an external system</em>, to which your system communicates. If not, then it cannot be an actor, and you should mandatory make an additional UML modelling to clarify the overall system structure (component diagram + sequences).</p>

<p>The fact that the data is individual has nothing to do with this decision. :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are use cases (for the mobile app) like ""showing information about
  something"" oder ""refresh data"" necessary? Because i think they are not
  necessary for the business logic. What do you think?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are building this mobile app, and <em>these are the requirements to implement</em>, than you should definitelly capture them as use cases.</p>

<p>What do you mean by ""they are not necessary for the business logic""?</p>

<p>What is scope of your system in the first place? (mobile app, mobile app + server/database or something else)?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (after clearing up the system scope)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are building the mobile app AND the database. So we are not just
  getting data from there and send data. We´re modelling the whole
  system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The scope is now clear - databese/server cannot be an actor, as it is part of the scope. The only actor I see is the mobile app user. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>when just placing the user beeing an actor and the app beeing the
  system i don´t know how to describe the use case, because i think i
  have to mention in the uce case description that data was send to
  server, etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do not have to put everything to the use case description, I will come back to this shortly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example: one use case is about taking a picture and send this to
  the server- –</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what's the problem with this UC? The actor is the mobile app user and the use case is ""Upload picture"" (it can optionally include taking the picture).</p>

<p>I think you are confused with a mix of several concerns that you try to put all in use case model, and that is not possible.</p>

<p>So, I recommend you to separate the cpncerns (aspects of your system) making the following diagrams:</p>

<ol>
<li>business level: an <strong>activity diagram</strong> showing the overall usage/business workflow of the app </li>
<li>a <strong>use case model</strong> to capture the reqs</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Be sure to make this model simple and from the Actor perspective. Just identify a small set of meaningful interactions the Actor can perform (not to low level).
For example: ""Upload photo"", ""Refresh data"" might be some solid UCs</em></p>

<ol>
<li>(optional) <strong>conceptual/data model</strong> (to clear up the relevant data structures)</li>
<li>system structure via <strong>component/deployment diagram</strong> (here you clearly have at least 3 components: mobile app, WEB server (or whatever receives the requests from the mobile app) and the database</li>
<li><strong>communication mechanisms</strong> - sequence diagram(s) using components </li>
</ol>

<p>And now you need some ""glue"" to relate the different concepts - for each use case make a sequence(s) that show how it works, using the elements from the component diagram (+ actor of couurse).</p>

<p>The point is to ""open up"" the use cases and show their internal implementation in terms of the system structure elements. </p>

<pre><code>The user needs the application to be responsive at all times.
The user must not be confused as to what is a button and what is not.
The user must be able to save personal preferences within area A of the application.
The user must be able to use the application offline.
The user must be able to retain their personal preferences if they log in on any device.

<p>If that is not the correct place to put them then where should I put them, also if there is anything else that looks wrong with the SRS just say, I'm always looking to improve my skills!</p>
","<documentation><software-design><requirements><srs>","23095142","<p>I would keep the user requirements where you have them listed at 2.5 because the flow of information that follows is the user dependencies/assumptions.

I would ordinarily assume that the users needs would be defined within the scope and purpose of the project instead of needing a section down further explaining what the user requires, or the ""why"" of the project. </p>

"23052528","How to know if authentication is really a requirement","<p>We have a small webapplication where users can mark spots on a map. We don't authenticate users, because we don't need to. Marked Spots aren't secret at all, everybody should see them and things should be very open and transparent to everybody. Because there is nothing to authorize we also don't need to authenticate. Nevertheless we keep something like a user profile in a cookie. A user can store default values for some fields in this ""wallet"" cookie so that he only need to type it once. </p>

<p>That's our little anarchy app ;) ...but as said: It's simple and it's fast and the users like that. </p>

<p>But:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basically there <strong>IS</strong> a need of some security, just to make sure the system isn't filled with nonsense from people who aren't interested in the intention of the app. So from my point of view that is a nonfunctional requirement (my point of view as an system architect)</li>
<li>Also the (group of) users say that they want ""a login"" for some reason, but actually they can't tell why</li>
</ul>

<p>What I am trying to do now is to find out what they really want. I assume their requirement isn't ""authentication"" but something they think that a login is needed for. So for our next couple of sprints I am trying to formulate some user stories to cover this requirements and to ask the users for their goals and benefits.</p>

<p>My question now is: Does it make sense to write a user story like this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>As users of system XY, we want user authentication by login, so that we can be sure that only serious input is generated.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: How would you point out the need for authentication and how it should be done (to keep things simple and not to provide an obstacle for users)? Can ""authentication"" be a goal in a requirement?</p>

<p>Some more considerations on this issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users don't want to type passwords. They want some kind of SSO</li>
<li>Some users told, that they want everybody to mark spots, but they don't want everybody to see them (so everyone is allowed to write, only some are allowed to read). That's a totally new goal in our app, but I still don't get the benefit yet.</li>
<li>that also implies, that there are privileged users, and that there is a need for user management, administration UIs and groups and so on...</li>
</ul>
","<authentication><requirements><user-stories>","23056378","<p>Yes, it makes sense.</p>

<p>The issue with simple cookies is that if you lose the cookie, there is no way become that user again.</p>

<p>That said I think these stories are what you need (this include the extra points you make):</p>

<ol>
<li>As a logged-in user I want to become anonymous so another user of the same browser won't be identified as me</li>
<li>As a user I want to identify as a previous user so I can resume my work</li>
<li>As a user I want to register as a (google) user so that I don't have to create new credentials</li>
<li>As a logged-in user I want some of my spots to be private so that I can mark places I don't want the general public to know</li>
<li>[Epic] As a logged-in user I want to be able to manage my spots</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see none of these stories is prescriptive in the way you solve it, or track who is whom. They all describe real, valuable problems that your users might want solved.</p>

","<specifications><requirements><contract><b2b>","22635587","<p>Software requirement specification is one among <code>‘must have’</code> document, which is equally important for business and the technical team. </p>

<p>SRS act as a foundation document for <code>technical team</code> to prepare for any high or low level technical specification including the solution architecture. I am not adding more at technical side since that wasn’t this question.</p>

<p>Now when it comes to business and in particular the agreement, the SRS communicate and act as a safe bridge between two business. This outlines what consumer can expect  from a complete software and what service provider agree to provide.  This means, both parties get their ground to talk and to negotiate.</p>

<p>Ideally,  when we prepare SRS, we include points such as <code>product scope, business function, area of coverage, future directio</code>n and list goes on and on. And this document later <code>‘signed’</code> by the stakeholders including the product owners and end user. This <code>agreement gives both parties a structured understanding of their responsibilities</code>. </p>

<p>Therefore, for me, it is less likely to initiate any project without a draft version of SRS.</p>

<p>Finally, I wanted to touch the software development process. As you know, we have handful of development process, which we follow to simplify our life of software development. Eg: <code>Waterfall, VModel, RUP, URUP, Agile are some of them.</code></p>

<p>Irrespective of any particular process, if it can provide following;</p>

<ol>
<li>a pleasant journey of end to end software development and it’s
management.</li>
<li>has the ability to align and adopt changing business demand.</li>
</ol>

<p>What happens if customer change their mind ?</p>

<p>Customer shall <code>change</code> their mind over the course of development. Such changes are addressed differently in different process.  In case of <code>waterfall</code>, any breaking changes or extra requirement must go through a change requirement management process. This will help you to communicate and quantify time and cost. When it comes to <code>agile</code>, we have to add/update/prioritize user stories followed by its impact, cost etc.</p>

<p>In one of the accepted answer, it was mentioned as <code>‘no upfront SRS’</code> in agile. I prefer it be reworded as <code>‘no complete SRS upfront’</code>. This means, it is less likely to have a complete SRS now a days due to nature of business. But this doesn’t means that no SRS.</p>

<p>To conclude, SRS must be your ‘must have’ document when you deal with external customers. Hence it doesn't really matter which process you follow in your organization.</p>

The more formal behavioral diagrams - State machine and Activity diagrams. But think of them later.</p>

<p>The more common structural model - components diagram. There you show components, their dependencies, their info exchange, what component is an item of the another, container component, what component is a parent (more common case) of another one. Surely, it will cover all your need now. What is better for you, because of its not full formality, it can show not only structure, but behavioral elements, too.  Later, if you will want more abstractness, formality and exactness, try the class diagram.</p>

<p>What you have seen at the link mentioned is not an effective class diagram. It is such only formally. The blood of class diagram are associations, and there are only two of them.

","<bdd><agile><specifications><requirements><atdd>","20319394","<h3>Regarding question 1:</h3>

<p>The most important part of developing any system is that the development team has a conversation with the product owner. First find out the crux of the feature which they require. I'll answer this question by working through an example; let us say that the product owner may want a facility to login to their new website. This requirement could be written as:</p>

<pre><code>In order to gain access to the website's facilities
As a user
I want to be able to login to the website
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that I'm using the <a href=""http://docs.behat.org/guides/1.gherkin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Gherkin</a> domain specific language for writing the scenarios and features in this answer)</p>

<p>With the product owner's key requirement specified, you should now discuss with them how you think this feature should be implemeneted from a users perspective (keep it high-level, don't use technical jargon, discuss with the business to find out what they want). So the first ""happy path"" scenario you might identify could be:</p>

<pre><code>Given a user is on the login screen
When they submit valid login credentials
Then they gain access to the main website
</code></pre>

<p>After further discussion with the product owner they tell you that as the website contains extremely sensitive information, and that any failed log-in attempts should be reported to a system administrator. This would result in another scenario:</p>

<pre><code>Given a user is on the login screen
When they submit invalid login credentials
Then the system administrator is informed of the failed log-in attempt
And the user is informed that their login attempt failed
</code></pre>

<p>At this point the product owner might say that these are the only scenarios they want for logging into the system. So from the development teams perspective no more investigation would need to be done regarding this feature (so you wouldn't need to write any more user stories). Sure, at a later point in the projects development, the product owner might also tell you that they'd like to inform a user when they last logged into their site before reaching the main website, but you'd only need to worry about this when they ask for it.</p>

<h3>Regarding question 2:</h3>

<p>The organisation should be verifying the products against ""living"" documentation e.g. using <a href=""http://cukes.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">Cucumber</a>(for example) which generates tests from the scenarios detailed above.</p>

<p>Also as I said in the answer to question 1, you should identify ""just enough"" of the scenarios/use cases to satisfy the product owner. What the product owner asks for is the complete specification. Don't try and second guess what the product owner might want because this may result in be a classic case of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren&#39;t_gonna_need_it"" rel=""nofollow"">YAGNI</a>.</p>

<p>This is essentially of the form:</p>
<pre><code>(a and b and c, f, g, h)

<p>This tuple, regardless of its contents will evaluate to <code>True</code>, e.g:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; if (False,False,False):
    print &quot;Was True&quot;

Was True
</code></pre>
<p>This happens because the <em>tuple</em> itself is considered in a <code>True</code>/<code>False</code> sense.</p>
<p>In Python the following values are considered false <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python Documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>None</p>

</li>
<li><p>any empty mapping, for example, {}.</p>
</li>
<li><p>instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a

</ol>
<p>All other values are considered true — so objects of many types are always true.</p>

<p>As the tuple is <strong>not</strong> empty <code>(,)</code> it will be considered <code>True</code>, hence the expression evaluates to <code>True</code>. You need to replace the <code>,</code>'s with an appropriate Boolean operator. This will stop the expression being treated as a tuple becase it will be of the form <code>(a)</code></p>
<hr />
<p>There are logical problems in your expression, you'll need to work out the correct chain of conditions for your logic. However you must fix the tuple creation problem (above) as well. Appropriate logic may be:</p>
<pre><code>#if fistname is not all spaces, and is of correct length, and (is either all alphabetical or contains a character in characterlist)

<p>This part is the problem. What you want to do is test whether each character in <code>firstname</code> is a letter, space, apostrophe, or hyphen. This doesn't do that. Unless you were actually expecting this code to do that, it's not particularly relevant what it actually does; it suffices to say that it does something completely unlike what you wanted.</p>

<p>Here's a code snippet that actually does check each letter against the constraints. It loops over each character, checking whether it's a letter or one of the few allowed non-letter characters:</p>

<pre><code>for letter in firstname:
    if not (firstname.isalpha() or firstname in "" '-""):
        return False

<p>You could also use set operations to check whether the set of allowed characters is a superset of the set of input characters:</p>

<p>Shortly speaking, if you need to design High Level Architecture Diagram, you are less required to have skills at good diagram structure such as UML. <strong>High Level Architecture Diagram</strong> should be <strong>simple and cannot be simpler</strong>, <strong>represent the business process</strong> and <strong>understandable by anyone, even the management</strong>. It should explain how the business flows, and handling for every cases available, even for negative case (error or exception in business level).</p>

<p>It will help the management understand the requirement clearer and pitfalls for such decisions, and help to redesign early.</p>

<p>For Low Level Architecture Diagram, you are required to have a decent skill for UML diagram (don't know if there is other format out there). It is required so you can catch any technical issue such as authentication and race conditions, and design pitfalls.</p>

<p>I would like to have a Facebook App Center page for my application (Android / iOS).
However I have no real need of facebook login in my game.

"19338788","Do BDD/ATDD stories replace the need for traditional requirements?","<p>From what I can tell from online forums and posts, one of the main focuses of BDD/ATDD seems to be on discussion and ensuring that the customer, developers, testers and other relevant parties are involved in the understanding what the system must do. </p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Do BDD/ATDD stories replace the need for traditional requirement specifications, such as the those captured using the <a href=""http://www.volere.co.uk/template.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Volere Template</a>?</p>

<p>Because the traditional requirement specifications are one of the key inputs for developers and testers, traditional requirement specifications tend to be comprehensive.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Should BDD/ATDD stories also be comprehensive enough to allow a system to be fully tested?</p>
","<bdd><requirements><specifications><atdd>","19341367","<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Instead of looking at this question as a black-and-white situation, we should better understand how these two requirements capture methods get along with each other. Writing a <code>story</code> in the BDD/ATDD methodologies, or in <code>Scrum</code> for example, does not imply removing the templates like <code>volere</code> off the table. If we take a look at the <code>volere</code> requirements specification <a href=""http://www11.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Lehre/WS0809/PR-SWE/Material/volere-template.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, we can see that most of the information regards to project-related issues, and the shell used for functional requirements is far from being different to a story. They just have different information, not exclusive one.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Here we have the advantage coming from the methodology itself. BDD comes from <code>TDD</code>, we can more or less rely on the test-first oriented process to allow the team to test the system. But, as I mentioned in question 1, making a BDD/ATDD story more comprehensive is not a sin, and wouldn't compromise the general idea of the story. This would also prove useful when interacting with more experienced clients.</p>

"19176730","Are there exceptions to the rule that requirements should be atomic?","<p>I'm reviewing a requirements spec where some of the requirements include the word ""and"" or sometimes even a list of required functionality.</p>

<p>Am mostly thinking these should be broken up but this does have the downside of making a long document even longer and even less readable - which in practice may mean its intended audience ends up skimming over it or only reading sections rather than absorbing the whole thing.</p>

<p>However, there are some requirements where it seems a bit silly to break them up. E.g: there are a lot of get/set operations, which always go together - it seems a bit overkill to always break them up into ""The user shall be able to get..."", ""The user shall be able to set..."" Other examples are enable/disable, validation lists, supported platforms/browsers etc.</p>

<p>Just wondering if anyone has had similar thoughts and whether it might sometimes be OK to break the rule of atomicity?</p>
","<specifications><requirements><atomic><convention>","19219367","<p>My opinion is that you do not have to break up the requirements, as long as you uniquely identify them. E.g. ""[REQ1] The user should be able to [a] set ... and [b] get ..."" In this way you keep the document readable and also keep the possibility of separately tracing the atomic parts. </p>

"18850892","Is there such a thing as a ""Non-Functional Use Case""?","<p>I'm reading a System Requirements Document that was produced using Sparx Enterprise Architect. All requirements are mapped to particular Use Cases.</p>

<p>A few of the non-functional requirements for ""high availability"" are mapped to a Use Case called ""Provide High Availability"", marked as <code>&lt;&lt;non-functional&gt;&gt;</code>. Am fairly new to all this and struggling to decide if it makes sense for a Use Case be non-functional - hence the question.</p>

<p>If the answer is yes then great - but if not, I'd be interested to know people's opinions on how such requirements should map to Use Cases (if at all).</p>
","<uml><high-availability><use-case><requirements>","18855186","<blockquote>
  <p>A few of the non-functional requirements for ""high availability"" are
  mapped to a Use Case called ""Provide High Availability"", marked as
  &lt;>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the saying goes, ""if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail"".  Use Cases exist to identify the value a system provides for its user(s).  So they're meant to describe functional things: stuff the system does.</p>

<p>So I wouldn't generally recommend capturing non-functionals in this way.  However: that's not to say they can't be captured in Use Cases. It can be very useful <em>within</em> functional use cases to specify their non-functional requirements. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Use Case: Submit Order
{...functional description...}

Availability: 9-5 mon-fri
Volumes: 5000 peak per day
...
</code></pre>

<p>That ties the non-functional requirement directly to the function it supports.  Which makes sense - since non-functionals have no purpose or context without function.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll find that many Use Cases share the same non-functionals.  You don't want to duplicate, so need to find a way to factor out.  I prefer to do that in a separate document.</p>

<p>But there's no law against capturing in a 'Use Case'.  Whilst it violates the theory there are reasons to do it in practice: e.g. limitations of the modelling tool (can't link UCs to a document) and/or desire to keep all in one place.</p>

<p>Fundamentally it boils down to theory and practice.  In theory, there's no such thing as a non-functional Use Case.  In practice creating a UC to hold non-functionals might make sense.  So long as everyone understands its really just a convenient container rather than a bona-fide piece of functionality I wouldn't get worked up about it.</p>

"17098860","When does WCF service call it's constructor?","<p>I have a default configuration service (I believe this is per session). I am slightly confused about the WCF initialization policy. I've read a lot of suggestions towards not using constructors to begin with, but in my case, it seems like the intuitive to do along with changing to per-request mode from per-session.</p>

<p>Basically I have information passed in the HTTP headers that is required in all of the public interface methods, so it makes sense to parse them in a single method that's executed. Then again, I keep hoping that there's actually a better way to do this as I want to use the per-session model.</p>

<p>How can I execute such header parsing code before the actual methods? Furthermore, lets say I manage to do it - is there a way to disable this sort of behavior on a single method?</p>

<p>[edit] Also, say it works on per-session basis. Can I trust that the same initialization, when called again by a client, is serving the same client (I assume this is what per-session means, but security is important in my service so I'd rather be sure).</p>

<p>Message inpectors should also contain operation info so you can use it to allow anonymous access to some service methods.</p>

","<project-management><scrum><requirements>","17004665","<p>Frankly I believe you to be misunderstood as you have mangled multiple Scrum roles into your definition of a ""stakeholder"".</p>

<p>The classic definition of Stakeholders is that they are people with legitimate interests in the project. Stakeholders are NOT always product owners and they should not be confused with a Product Owners role in Scrum.</p>

<p>The product owner, helps define the backlog of the scrum team, sets priorities of units of work and communicates progress to ""stake holders"". These units of work are first ""validated"" with the Product Owner, and usually again in a sprint ending demo / wrap up of the iterations work to ""stakeholders"". </p>

<p>Customers or users are who your're building software for. They can also be considered ""stakeholders"" however I would not do so. I personally like to keep a clear line drawn between stakeholders of the project ""support / sales / business executives / etc"" and ""customers / users"".</p>

"16843908","Symfony2 - force use to complete required action","<p>There are business cases where specific actions or requests 'must' be followed by a finishing action or request.</p>

<p>An example we are all familiar with is the requirement to log-in to access secure areas.</p>

<p>This may include cases where a certain event or problem has occurred and must be immediately addressed.  This would be enforced by the entire system redirecting a user to a page, and only a specific set of continuation requests are allowed.</p>

<p>Now I do know ways to implement this in Symfony2 (add request listeners and redirect when required), however, currently I do not have a full grasp of the best practice to do this, my main concern is how to safely specify which actions count as valid continuations.</p>

<p>What I am looking for is either a) the best methodology to deal with this, or b) details on any existing bundles or features already built into Symfony2 that are designed to do this.</p>

<p>Non-functional requirements are sometimes defined in terms of metrics (i.e. something that can be measured about the system) to make them more tangible. Non-functional requirements may also describe aspects of the system that don't relate to its execution, but rather to its evolution over time (e.g. maintainability, extensibility, documentation, etc.).</p>

<li><p>Functional requirements specifies a function that a system or system component must be able to perform. It can be documented in various ways. The most common ones are written descriptions in documents, and use cases. </p></li>
<li><p>Use cases can be textual enumeration lists as well as diagrams, describing user actions. Each use case illustrates behavioural scenarios through one or more functional requirements. Often, though, an analyst will begin by eliciting a set of use cases, from which the analyst can derive the functional requirements that must be implemented to allow a user to perform each use case.</p></li>

<li>Technical details </li>
<li>Data manipulation</li>
<li>Data processing</li>
<li>Other specific functionality</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A typical functional requirement will contain a unique name and number, a brief summary, and a rationale. This information is used to help the reader understand why the requirement is needed, and to track the requirement through the development of the system.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Non-functional requirements</h2>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/16476014/1045444"">LBushkin</a> have already explained more about Non-functional requirements. I will add more.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Non-functional requirements are any other requirement than functional requirements. This are the requirements that specifies criteria that can be used to <strong>judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>Non-functional requirements are in the form of <strong>""system shall be ""</strong>, an overall property of the system as a whole or of a particular aspect and not a specific function. The system's overall properties commonly mark the difference between whether the development project has succeeded or failed.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-functional requirements - can be divided into two main categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Execution qualities</strong>, such as security and usability, which are observable at run time.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution qualities</strong>, such as testability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the software system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Non-functional requirements place restrictions on the
product being developed, the development process,
and specify external constraints that the product must
meet.</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://www.utdallas.edu/~chung/RE/IEEE830-1993.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">IEEE-Std 830 - 1993</a> lists 13 non-functional requirements to be included in a Software Requirements Document.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Performance requirements</li>
  <li>Interface requirements</li>
  <li>Operational requirements</li>
  <li>Resource requirements</li>
  <li>Verification requirements</li>
  <li>Acceptance requirements</li>
  <li>Documentation requirements</li>
  <li>Security requirements</li>
  <li>Portability requirements</li>
  <li>Quality requirements</li>
  <li>Reliability requirements</li>
  <li>Maintainability requirements</li>
  <li>Safety requirements</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether or not a requirement is expressed as a functional or a non-functional requirement may depend:</p>

<ul>
<li>on the level of detail to be included in the requirements document</li>
<li>the degree of trust which exists between a system customer and a
system developer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ex. A system may be required to present the user with a display of the number of records in a database. This is a functional requirement. How up-to-date [update] this number needs to be, is a non-functional requirement. If the number needs to be updated in real time, the system architects must ensure that the system is capable of updating the [displayed] record count within an acceptably short interval of the number of records changing.</p>

","<iphone><ios><wifi><hardware><indoor-positioning-system>","15861228","<p>Indoor positioning is a very vast field and many different solutions are available which all use a different combination of hardware/software. Some need no specific hardware to work, others need a very expensive infrastructure to be put in place. In the end, it all depends on the accuracy you are trying to achieve. Here are the most common solutions used, I ordered them by the type of technology used:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Wifi</strong>: two main techniques are used here, trilateration and fingerprinting. Both do not require specific hardware if your uni already has deployed access points (APs). Trilateration converts signal strength to distance and then intersect circles (almost exactly like GPS). In general this has poorish accuracy and you need to know the exact position of APs for it to work. Fingerprinting is a pattern matching technique where you first build a wireless map of the environment and then match the measurement against this map.</li>
<li><strong>Bluetooth</strong>: same techniques as above can be used with Bluetooth nodes. Of course, there's less Bluetooth nodes than Wifi so you might need to deploy some extra nodes for it to be accurate enough. Same accuracy as Wifi (roughly 5 meters)</li>
<li><strong>Dead reckoning</strong>: uses an accelerometer, gyroscope and compass to calculate the speed of heading of the user. Needs to be initialized and calibrated regularly by another absolute positioning technique. Subject to drift so accuracy degrades quickly over time. Upside is its very cheap, no extra hardware or initial survey phase are needed.</li>
<li><strong>UWB</strong>: very accurate techniques based on time of flight measurements. Requires expensive hardware for both transmitter and receiver. You can achieve cm accuracy with this but it's probably not what you're after</li>
</ol>

<p>This is still an field of research so it's not that easy to find something that just works. I suggest contacting the IT department of your university, if they run a Cisco system, I know some of them provide some sort of positioning capabilities but I don't have much details. </p>

<p>As for your iPhone question, any app that accesses the private API to access Wifi measurements will be rejected by the App store, so you won't be able to publish anything that relies on Wifi. You can still use it for research purpose though, you'll just have to figure out the code yourself as there's no official documentation (some unofficial doc is out there though)</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

"15626330","Can I mix use case and deployment UML diagrams?","<p>I am new to the world of UML and have so far learnt the basics of use case, activity and deployment UML diagrams. I have a requirement of where users interact with a system e.g. user sending an email, which is then processed by a system and then sent to an agent (person) who then responds and interacts once again with a system. </p>

<p>I am having a hard time picturing these requirements and whether it should be a combination of use case, activity or deployment. Can I intermingle them? What is standard practice?</p>
","<uml><requirements><use-case>","15626983","<p>As you know, use cases are used to capture requirements. When identifying and detailing use cases, you look at the problem from the perspective of users. Only focus on what an actor expects the system to do. First step is to identify the use cases and actors and then detail the use case flows.</p>

<p><strong>1- Identify the use cases and actors</strong></p>

<p>In your example send email could be a use case initiated by the end user (your actor). What happens next (e.g system sending a notification to the agent) could be modeled as part of the flow of this use case.</p>

<p>Another use case could be the agent actor handling what they have to do after receiving the notification from the system (a prerequisite of this use case could be that a notification has been received).</p>

<p>Note that you could combine these two use cases together and have the agent as a secondary actor (secondary actor interacts with the use case but does not initiate it). Whether you do this or not, is a modeler's choice and depends on the size of use cases, number of use cases and many other things.</p>

<p><strong>2- Detail the use cases</strong></p>

<p>After identifying use cases and actors, you should detail use cases. The most important part is to detail the use case flow (step by step interactions of actor and system). This can be written as text or drawn as an activity diagram.</p>

<hr>

<p>So to answer your question: yes it is possible and very common to combine activity diagrams and use cases; that is an activity diagram drawn to show the flow of steps of a use case.</p>

<p>Deployment diagrams on the other hand are totally irrelevant to the requirement elicitation phase. They model the physical structure of the system and how hardware components and software components interact. </p>

<p>In fact, it is very odd that you have learned component diagrams before class diagrams, sequence diagrams, state diagrams and many other diagrams.</p>

<p>My main concern is if you have a very complex use case diagram it defeats the purpose of having one as it won't be easy to read.</p>

<p>So, my question is as follows. Is my thinking behind this correct? Is it best to only model 'real' goals in the use case diagrams or everything that the actors can initiate?</p>
","<uml><use-case><requirements>","15524246","<p>It is not wrong to exclude some use cases from your diagram, and indeed it might be a good idea. For instance, if you are going to show your diagram to the business department, you can draw an UML model that describes the operational use cases. If you are going to hand down your diagram to the programmers, you would want to give them a complete description of what they have to implement. These are just <em>models</em> of your system.</p>

<p>When one draws a use case diagram, usually one also writes the behavior of each use case (as free-text description, pseudocode, or by using interaction diagrams). </p>

<p>The UML specification says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A use case is the specification of a set of actions performed by a system, which yields an observable result that is, typically, of value for one or more actors or other stakeholders of the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Login</em> and <em>Logout</em> are observable to the user. While the user will not visit your site with the only goal of logging in, such use case certainly has some execution flow that you also want to describe. If you don't allow users to initiate a login by themselves, there will be use cases that <strong>include</strong> the functionality of <em>login</em>. A user may have also interest on logging out before leaving the site, so that no session data will remain stored in his computer.</p>

<p><em>Select 'electronics' department</em>, <em>Select 'vehicles' department</em>... Why not just <em>Select department</em> (I suppose that they are not too different). </p>

<p>I would draw this and other use cases, as long as they are relevant to the model. </p>

<p>In the same as before, if you are happy with it.</p>

<p>It really should. That will help developers and reduce the risk of redundant logic being developed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should every function be described new?</p>

<p>Creating so much duplicate content will in most cases be against economic reason.
It will give you little to no added value but take a lot of precious time and money. Reusing requirements helps to do better.</p>

<p>Also, if you specify on top of existing requirements, you'll get a pretty good idea of what you can use from the existing, where to configure stuff and where to add something new (see your 2nd sentence).</p>

<p>Yes, you'll base your requirements on what you have specified already.</p>

<p>Exceptions to this rule may be (a) that specifying the new requirements as a diff is more effort than starting from scratch. Then you might ask whether the new stuff is really based on the existing or not.</p>

<p>Or, (b) you may find the already documented requirements to be of very poor quality in retrospect. Then it can help to give it a new approach.</p>

<p>You can fit it in the existing diagram if you've got the space. Or you can create sub diagrams and link to them for the details. The goal should be to keep the diagrams lean and understandable.

","<reflection><programming-languages><requirements>","15157926","<p>I know that you prefer a statically-typed language, but if you consider a dynamically-typed one Smalltalk may be a good fit, since everything is an object (classes and methods are no exception ot this rule) and thus everything can be manipulated (not only queried, but also changed). Going to your requirements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a class (or interface) C, the programming language allows the
  user access to a list of all classes which extend/implement C.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Smalltalk there is no built-in notion of interface (though I think that I've seen extensions that added support for it). However, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Given a class, find it direct subclasses: <code>Number subclasses</code> answers <code>{Fraction. Float. Integer}</code>.</li>
<li>Or all the hierarchy under it: <code>Number allSubclasses</code>  answers <code>an OrderedCollection(Fraction Float Integer ScaledDecimal SmallInteger LargePositiveInteger LargeNegativeInteger)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also find all classes that implement a given selector (<code>pop</code> in this case):</p>

<p><code>SystemNavigation default allClassesImplementing: #pop</code> answers <code>{ContextPart. FileSystemGuide. LIFOQueue. Stack}</code></p>

<p>As you can see, defining an ""Interface"" object to query for classes that implement a set of methods is quite easy (just have a collection of method names and query for classes implementing each of them, adding the classes to a set). However if you want to explicitly state in the class that it implements an interface, then you'll need to do more work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The programming language allows the user to iterate through all the
  variables and methods of a class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Point instVarNames</code> answers <code>#('x' 'y')</code></p>

<p><code>Point allMethods</code> answers a collection of <code>CompiledMethod</code>s (the object that represents a method)</p>

<p><code>Point allSelectors</code> answers a collection of all the method names that an instance of that class can answer to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The user is able to determine the number and types of arguments a
  function will take.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case you interact with compiled methods and ask them for the number of arguments they need (there is no notion of parameter type):</p>

<p><code>(Point methodNamed: #x) numArgs</code> answers 0, since it is just a getter.</p>

<p><code>(Point methodNamed: #+) numArgs</code> answers 1</p>

"14931780","More productive Grooming Sessions","<p>I'm looking for a way to make our Scrum Grooming Sessions more productive. At the moment, it feels like it's taking us a long time to create user stories and acceptance criteria. For a one hour session, we typically end up with 2 - 4 user stories including acceptance criteria. The process to get there feels painful, taking a long time.</p>

<p>Participants include members from Dev + Architecture, QA, BA, Customer, Product Owner (me), Usability.</p>

<p>The problem I see is that we have good discussions, but then the process of wording the stories - and even more so the Acceptance Criteria - takes an awfully long time.</p>

<p>Since we are a distributed team, we have to do this over the phone, screen sharing and a collaborative editing environment. This certainly has an impact on the productivity, since we're not in the same room, but I still feel that our process could be improved.</p>

<p>Some questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How many stories do you typically end up with after a Grooming Session?</li>
<li>Do you create the Acceptance Criteria as part of the Grooming Session, or outside?</li>
<li>How do you create User Stories and what process works for you?</li>
</ul>
","<agile><scrum><requirements>","14979510","<p><strong>Ask the team!</strong></p>

<p>Fair, my answer is short so let me explain.  The team has better context of your technology, issues, cultures and product than anyone else here; thus they are the best to answer it.  This is a typical topic you should bring up in a retrospective and in the spirit of continual improvement - Inspect and Adapt.  Keep adapting and trying things until things start getting better.  </p>

<p>So in your next retro, bring it up and inspect the problem and admit it is unproductive.  Look at opportunities to adapt and do it.</p>

<p>Some Tips (but not as a Scrum Master)</p>

<ul>
<li>Scrum recommends 10% of your capacity spent on grooming</li>
<li>There is no rule that everyone should do it in a meeting</li>
<li>Have meetings to manage exceptions or areas where more formal discussion is required</li>
<li>Try some pair grooming </li>
<li>Remember a Story is a placeholder for communication, not a contract</li>
<li>Get the core acceptance criteria,  build the rest in planning sessions and in sprint</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>How many stories do you typically end up with after a Grooming Session?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just enough for the next two sprints with a Just-In-Time attitude</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you create the Acceptance Criteria as part of the Grooming Session, or outside?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both, the critical business acceptance criteria in a formal session with the PO and the functional ones outside of the session as they are identified. Acceptance Criteria should be added the whole time, even in sprint planning and within the sprint.  Avoid treating them as a contract.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you create User Stories and what process works for you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I normally start with the business focus story that delivers on a business need.  In grooming we break it down to functional stories by using an action/verb or use case model.  These can be written as stories.  In a typical 1 hour session, you can easily brainstorm over 50 requirements at a high level.   As the implementation sprint gets closer, you can break them down into INVEST stories; but report at the functional level.</p>

<p>When sending clients required hardware requirements specifications, how do you note the requirements in these areas?  What are the relevant measures of network performance? (Or is it simply requiring IOPS=<i>x</i> )</p>
","<networking><documentation><hardware><requirements>","14567530","<p>Generally, there is more than one level of detail for requirements. You'd typically differentiate the levels of detail into a range from 0 (rough mission statement) to 4 (technical details), for example.</p>

<p>So if you specify that your SAN shall be operating with at least a bandwidth capacity of x, that would be a high number on that scale. Make sure to break down your main ideas (The system shall be responsive, in order to prevent clients from becoming impatient and leaving for competitors....) into more measurable aims (as the one above).</p>

<p>Stephen Withall has written down good examples in his book ""Software Requirement Patterns"". See chapter 9, page 191 ff., it is not that expensive.
He breaks it down into recommendations on, and I quote, Response Time, Throughput, Dynamic Capacity, Static Capacity and Availability.</p>

<p>Of course, that's software! Because basically, you'd probably be well advised to begin with defining what the whole system asserts under specified circumstances: When do we start to measure? (e.g. when the client request comes in at the network gateway); what average network delay do we assume that is beyond our influence? from how many different clients do we measure and from how many different autonomous systems do these make contact? Exactly what kind of task(s) do they execute and for which kind of resource will that be exceptionally demanding? When do we stop to measure? Do we really make a complete system test with all hardware involved? Which kinds of network monitoring will we provide at runtime? etc.</p>

<p>That should help you more than if you just assign a value to a unit like transfer rate/ IOPS which might not even solve your problem. If you find the network hardware to perform below your expectations later, it's rather easy to exchange. Especially if you give your hosting to an external partner. The software, however, is not easy to exchange.</p>

<p>Be sure to differentiate between what is a requirement or constraint that you have to meet, and what is actually a part of the technical solution you offer. There might be more solutions. Speed is a requirement (a vague one, though). Architecture for hardware is a solution.</p>

","<java><data-mining><weka>","14304988","<p>The answer/solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each algorithm that Weka implements has some sort of a summary info associated with it. In order to see it from the GUI, one has to click on algorithm (or filter) options and then click once more on <code>Capabilities</code> button. Then a small popup will show up containing some info regarding particular algorithm.</li>
<li>In case of <code>FPGrowth</code> - model attributes needs to be of <code>binary</code> type. In my case I had a mix od nominal and numeric parameters. I had to apply <code>NominalToBinary</code> filter which converted my nominal attributes to binary values. Then I had to apply flter <code>NumericToBinary</code> with selected option <code>ignoreClass</code> set to <code>true</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This has helped me to ""unlock"" <code>FPGrowth</code> in Weka.</p>

","<java><data-mining><weka>","47466013","<p>Adding to @ŁukaszBachman answer: 
You need to set class to ""No Class"" before applying filter operation. If you are using weka java api, then you need to add <code>data.setClassIndex(-1)</code> to your java code.</p>

<p>For example: To perform Nominal To Binary in Java: </p>

<pre><code>        NominalToBinary nn = new NominalToBinary();
        nn.setInputFormat(Data);
        Data.setClassIndex(-1);
        Data = Filter.useFilter(Data, nn);

","<c><http><webserver><requirements>","14201055","<p>An HTTP server is a simple text-based server; all protocol messages are sent in plain-text. Furthermore, it is stateless (i.e. no need to remember anything about previous connections - handle each request as if it was a new one). With these concepts in mind, you basically need to understand how <code>socket programming</code> works (and how to program well in C). Socket programming also depends on the library you are using (generally, <code>POSIX</code> is used for non-Windows systems, otherwise <code>WinSock2</code> is used for Windows).</p>

<p>The other features (HTML, js, etc.) are handled by the browser. The server simply sends the data to the client (generally via TCP unless you are recreating the transport protocol as well).</p>

<p>Also, arguably the best reference for socket programming (in C and C++) is <a href=""http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/"">Beej's Guide</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>On a very primitive level, the pseduocode for an HTTP server looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>while(1) {
  client = accept(); // Receive some connection
  recv(client, req); // Receive the request from the client
  // ... Do some HTTP request processing ...
  send(client, resp); // Send the client the response/data
}
</code></pre>

<p>That said, I just re-read your post and, perhaps, socket programming is not the best point to learn C. Not that it cannot be done (I think this is where I started as well, although now I see much easier routes), it's just much more difficult to wrap your head around both the language and the networking layer. There are many other things to create to get used to the idea of pointers, memory management, structs, etc. You can try creating simple file readers/writers creating some sort of inventory/calculation script. I just suggest these since socket API's look very foreign for first time users who are comfortable with C already.</p>

","<android><vim><requirements>","13673371","<p>It is doable with 1gb RAM and using vim/commandline tools. However, eclipse provides a project wide perspective which is hard to duplicate in vim (vim power users may be as productive, if not more though). So in terms of memory 1, 2gb RAM will be fine. Testing on devices is always better than emulators.</p>

<p>One thing else though, a commandline build with multiple module dependency is non-trivial to setup and maintain. This is because Google has historically been modifying the build.xml file, breaking existing build scripts fairly regularly. So if you are well versed with build script internals and prepared to work on them you should be ok.</p>

<p>Debugging Android apps without Eclipse based breakpoint debugging support may be a significant issue too. Some bugs are caught in a lot lesser time with this. So plan accordingly if you don't want to use Eclipse.</p>

<p>Eclipse also provides very good JUnit/Robotium support for writing test cases, You won't get this with vim.</p>

<p>As I wrote down these points I think running Eclipse in 2gb notebook should be possible (just don't run other apps with doing development) and thus is recommended.</p>

<li><strong>Stage 1: Discover Architectural Drivers</strong> --> Author encourages teams to focus on 4 drivers -- technical constraints, business constraints, high-level functional requirements, and quality attributes.  Specific elicitation techniques are not discussed and there are a wide variety of techniques out there.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2: Establish Project Scope</strong> --> basically, establish a notional design and make sure it aligns with discovered drivers.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 3: Create/Refine Architecture</strong> --> This is where you would apply many of the principles you mentioned in your question, SOLID, patterns use, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 4: Architecture Review</strong> --> A scenario-based review of the design with a team of reviewers in a formal or semi-formal process.  Based on the architectural drivers, this can be thought of as a variant of TDD for architecture design.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 5: Production Go/No-Go</strong>  --> skip to step 7 if design is Go.  go/no-go is not all or none for the entire system meaning a subset of elements might be ""go"" for production while other elements must be refined further</li>
<li><strong>Stage 6: Experimentation</strong>   --> This is really the core of the process.  If you don't understand something or aren't sure, you will often need to get your hands dirty and write some code to understand what needs to be done in the design.  repeat to step 3</li>
<li><strong>Stage 7: Production Planning</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stage 8: Production</strong> --> code construction begins, can happen in part or in whole</li>
</ul>

<p>The book outlines just about everything you need to know.  There are also several papers and presentations published by the author both leading up to the process released in the book and after.</p>

It's not necessary to have a 1-1 correlation between a requirement and a use-case; actually in most situations a single use-case will be based on several requirements and a requirement may appear in several use-cases.

        User user = retrieveUserFromDatabase(username);
        throwIfWrongpassword(user, password);

        verifyBiometricImage(user, password);
        verifyUserAge(user);
    }
}

<p>This is the result of a few requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users must authenticate to have acces to the system</li>
<li>Users can use biometric authentication instead on password auth</li>
<li>Underaged users must be authorized be parents or something like that.</li>
</ul>

<p>All those requirements were added in different poins of time, on different versions of the software.
A class-level, or even a method-level annotation won't suffice to effectively map requirements to code.
You'd have to use a ""line of code""-level annotation.
Of course, that's impractical.</p>

<p>The right way to do that is to follow a few best practices when using the source code repository and the bug tracker:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) Every requirement corresponds to one or more issues on the bug tracker</li>
<li>2) Every commit message starts with a corresponding issue key, like ""PROJ-123 - a nice feature""</li>
<li>3) When you do a release (meaning, incrementing your software version), you tell the bug tracker that those issues were fixed in that version.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to know what requirements were implemented in what version, ask your bug tracker.</p>

<p>If you need to know all the code that was produced for a given requirement, ask your source code repository (filter commits by log message)</p>

<p>If you need to know what is the requirement for a given line of code, ask your source code repository. GIT and SVN have a ""blame"" command that will tell you, for a given file, for each line of code, who commited it, when, and the commit message (which will have the issue number if everyone on the team is a good boy) - So this will work as that hypothetical ""line-of-code""-level annotation.</p>

<p>Using ""commit hooks"" can help you enforce rule 2) in an organization.</p>

<p>Maven has some degree of integration with JIRA and other bug trackers, and maybe it can help automate #3. But I haven't really used it like that. But if it doesn't do what you need, you can always <a href=""http://www.freedomsponsors.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">ask for more</a> :-)</p>

<p>1-  Define the unknown % in each requirement ( does it need research ? , do I need to try a prototype first ? ..etc) and for this type I'll make it clear to the customer that it need research and will give it a rough estimate [Sometimes the customer changes the priority or cancel the whole feature if the unknown factor 90% for an example) </p>

<p>2- Break down each requirement (known part) into small tasks provided that provided that each task estimate will not exceed 1 day (for an example : create table user , create orm method getuser..etc).</p>

<p>3- Add testing as a separate task (run more than test scenario) &amp; fixing code accordingly.</p>

<p>4- If any documentation is required then it should be added as a separate task as well even if it will take 30 min.</p>

<p>5- Define milestones it is very useful to do feature review sessions with the customer if possible (for an example : milestone one : demo feature 1,2,3) and add the feedback to the tasks log prioritized against remaining tasks.

<p>I would try to provide a neutral view based on the analysis &amp; implementation diagram that you have mentioned. Let me try to explain this with an example so that we can have a contextual discussion.</p>

<p>Assume that your organization has come up with the need to build a Human Resources Management System and for some reason or the other it is decided the product will be implemented internally. So, Engineering and HR teams start together on this and first draw up the <em>high-level requirements</em>, may be in a quick half-a-day workshop. The teams move forward by doing the detailed analysis followed by the implementations during the iterations. For example, ""The System needs to have provision for handling Employee Resignation"" could be part of your high-level requirements whereas ""The provision for Manager Approval, HR Processing, Due Settlements etc"" could be your Analysis. In this case your Analysis &amp; Implementation could look something like:</p>

<p>Iteration#1: 10% Analysis, 0% Implementation</p>

<p>Iteration#2: 20% Analysis, 0% Implementation</p>

<p>Iteration#3: 40% Analysis, 10% Implementation</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Again, this could be different if the Senior Management had asked you to provide an <em>'approximate'</em> resourcing and cost estimations (just like a formal project). Then you need to perform <em>a little more detailed analysis</em> during the first iterations.</p>

<p>Now, let us suppose the same HR System project has come to you from some other organization and you are providing IT services to them. Now, are you starting from ground-zero this time? No. Your customer would come to you with proper requirements document. You need to do sufficient analysis for the estimation and planning. You would have analyzed the system to a decent level before even you start with your high-level design. This itself would be, say, 60% your analysis. The remaining % is what the would be analyzed at micro levels in lateral cycles. [<em>Under the cover of ""iterative model"", can you go and tell your customer that you would estimate (and charge him accordingly) on a piece by piece basis? No.</em>] Because Cost is the major factor here. (Cost to you and Cost to the Customer)</p>

<p><em>So, practically speaking the % of analysis done depends on the stage you have entered into the project cycle and the work that was already done before it came to you.</em> Also, the bandwidth that you have on resourcing/costing factors will play their role too. In the end, there is no <em>f(x)</em> formula and it is fact-driven.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

","<resources><symfony><routes><requirements>","10622262","<p>Mainly, I think your problem comes from the dash character. Let me explain. Say the url entered is <code>/test-route-9</code>. With your requirements, the slug matched would be <code>test-route-</code> because your regex states that is characters between <code>a-z</code> or the dash <code>-</code> that can be matched.</p>

<p>Regex will match every thing it can, so it will ""eat"" the dash character. By ""eating"" it, the rest would be only <code>9</code> which would not be correct because the routing expects another dash before matching the <code>resource_id</code> portion. Hence, this url wouldn't match as you expect.</p>

<p>Simple fix is to separate components with a <code>/</code> instead of dash, or change the character separating your slug to differentiate it from the url component separator.</p>

<p>Fix by changing separator in url:</p>

<pre><code>prefix: /{slug}/{resource_id}
requirements:
    slug: ""[a-z\-]+""
    resource_id: ""\d+""

<p>I'm adding an answer for anyone using Doug Hellmann's excellent <a href=""https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"" rel=""noreferrer"">virtualenvwrapper</a> specifically since the existing answers didn't do it for me.</p>

<p>Some context:</p>

<ul>
<li>I work on some projects that are Python 2 and some that are Python 3; while I'd love to use <code>python3 -m venv</code>, it doesn't support Python 2 environments</li>
<li>When I start a new project, I use <code>mkproject</code> which creates the virtual environment, creates an empty project directory, and cds into it</li>
<li>I want to continue using virtualenvwrapper's <code>workon</code> command to activate any project irrespective of Python version</li>
</ul>

<p>Directions:</p>

<p>Let's say your existing project is named <code>foo</code> and is currently running Python 2 (<code>mkproject -p python2 foo</code>), though the commands are the same whether upgrading from 2.x to 3.x, 3.6.0 to 3.6.1, etc.  I'm also assuming you're currently inside the activated virtual environment.</p>

<p>1. Deactivate and remove the old virtual environment:</p>

<pre><code>$ deactivate
$ rmvirtualenv foo
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you've added any custom commands to the hooks (e.g., <code>bin/postactivate</code>) you'd need to save those before removing the environment.</p>

<p>2. Stash the real project in a temp directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ..
$ mv foo foo-tmp
</code></pre>

<p>3. Create the new virtual environment (and project dir) and activate:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkproject -p python3 foo
</code></pre>

<p>4. Replace the empty generated project dir with real project, change back into project dir:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ..
$ mv -f foo-tmp foo
$ cdproject
</code></pre>

<p>5. Re-install dependencies, confirm new Python version, etc:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python --version
</code></pre>

<p>If this is a common use case, I'll consider opening a PR to add something like <code>$ upgradevirtualenv</code> / <code>$ upgradeproject</code> to virtualenvwrapper.</p>

<p>Use of the <code>-p</code> or <code>--python</code> flag is supported on <code>virtualenv</code>, but not on <code>venv</code>. If you have more than one Python version and you want to specify which one to create the <code>venv</code> with, do it on the command line, like this:</p>

<pre><code>malikarumi@Tetuoan2:~/Projects$ python3.6 -m venv {path to pre-existing dir you want venv in}
</code></pre>

<p>You can of course upgrade with <code>venv</code> as others have pointed out, but that assumes you have already upgraded the Python that was used to create that <code>venv</code> in the first place. You can't upgrade to a Python version you don't already have on your system somewhere, so make sure to get the version you want, first, then make all the venvs you want from it.</p>

#Move the folder to a new one

<p><strong>2. Install Python</strong></p>
<p>Assuming that one doesn't have sudo access, <a href=""https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>pyenv</code></a> is a reliable and fast way to install <code>Python</code>. For that, one should run</p>

<p>and one gets the error</p>
<pre><code>bash: pyenv: command not found

<p>that is because <code>pyenv</code> path wasn't exported to <code>.bashrc</code>. It can be solved by executing the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=&quot;$HOME/.pyenv&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=&quot;$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then\n eval &quot;$(pyenv init -)&quot;\nfi' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc

<p>Then restart the shell</p>
<pre><code>exec &quot;$SHELL&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now one should install the Python version that one wants. Let's say version 3.8.3</p>
<pre><code>pyenv install 3.8.3

<p>One can confirm if it was properly installed by running</p>
<pre><code>pyenv versions

<p>The output should be the location and the versions (in this case 3.8.3)</p>
<p><strong>3. Create the new virtual environment</strong></p>
<p>Finally, with the new Python version installed, create a new virtual environment (let's call it <code>venv</code>)</p>
<pre><code>python3.8 -m venv venv

<p>Activate it</p>

","<documentation><report><methodology><requirements>","10152244","<p>when you say user input validation, it is integral part of a functionality to be completed.
let us say requirement says that input field should not contain any numeric data.So now it is functional requirement.You can verify that this is really need to be mentioned in the requirement.if it is requirement and is mentioned in the document, then this is a functional requirement.If this is not real requirement or may be implicitly implemented due to the implementation of some other functionality then need not worry too much.But nowadays we will validate user inputs for better stability of the application so this can be considered as functional requirement.</p>

<p>To just one thing related to non-functional requirement, performance of the application is not a part of functional requirement.It id the behavior of the application.So that way you can really differentiate it.</p>

  unrolling can cause the object code to be much larger.) If optional

  SQLite generally runs faster the more memory you give it.
  Nevertheless, performance is usually quite good even in low-memory

<p>That said, I would really love to have a tool that helps me map user stories to functional requirements, possibly even generating the matrix (in both directions) for easy reference.</p>

<p>What tools are there that might help me? Googling is no help at all. :)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<ms-word><requirements><specifications>","9664735","<p>Here is what we have decided to do.</p>

<p>There will be a High Level Design, and a Functional Specification document. 
The customer will get both, but the HDD will be written up front, for sign off, agreement and limiting of scope. 
The functional specification will also be signed off on, but incrementally - we will fill in a section as we decide what will be done, and get sign off.</p>

<p>The HDD will have User stories in it, each user story is a ticket in TFS, synched via teamspec.
The Func Spec will have tasks in it, which are user stories broken down into features/requirments. Teamspec again used to populate this stuff in the func spec.</p>

<p>So the only thing left is showing a matrix - I will use the ability of TFS to pop out a .xls file - if it shows the user story -> task breakdown, that gives me the matrix we need.</p>

<p>So that's it really.</p>

<p>It solves the issue of HDD, Func spec, mapping of requirements and items between the two, while still recording it in TFS for access via developers.</p>

<p>Thanks,
david</p>
","<oauth><saml>","9359657","<p>On the software side, the cost will really depend on what solution you're using. Both technologies have good opensource and commercial implementations (and often, the same product supports both). So, I don't think that the software costs will make a difference.</p>

<p>On the hardware part, SAML is probably a little more power-consuming, because it implies XML parsing, XML digital signature (which needs more resources than a simple digital signature).
But if you have a reasonable number of concurrent users, the raw-power of the most basic servers will be able to absorb the load without problems in each case.</p>

<p>To give some figures, our SAML 2.0 solution (which admittely is performance and not features-oriented) is able to generate ~100 SAML responses per second on my workstation (a low-end sandy bridge pentium). The main factor determining performance is CPU. I/O and memory are somewhat negligeable.</p>

<p>You are writing a program that uses two stacks. The data in each stack is already in descending order. You need to process the contents of both stacks in such a way that the output is printed on the screen ascending order. How would you write such a program?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I have this scenario already coded. My solution is to iterate over two separate stacks, merge them into a List by popping their items off until the stack is empty, and sort the list into the correct order.</p>
<p>However, it strikes me that the question is a bit vague on whether or not I should be merging the stacks. It's <em>kind</em> of implied, but it <em>kind</em> of isn't.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you were reading this question, how would you interpret it?</strong></em></p>

","<agile><requirements><specifications><user-stories><agile-project-management>","9200585","<p>You have to change your thought process here.</p>

<p>A user story is one or more sentences in the everyday or <strong>business language</strong> of the <strong>end user</strong> that captures <strong>what the user wants to achieve</strong>. For e.g. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a front desk representative, I would like to make a room

<ol>
<li>From the user/role (front desk representative) perspective</li>
<li>Goal oriented (make a room reservation quickly)</li>
</ol>

<p>But they lack details like various flows (payment etc), acceptance criteria, non-functional requirement specific (what does quickly mean in the e.g. story?). <strong>You create sub-stories to provide more details.</strong></p>

<p><strong>INVEST</strong> : <strong>I</strong>ndependent, <strong>N</strong>egotiable, <strong>V</strong>aluable, <strong>E</strong>stimatable, <strong>S</strong>mall, <strong>T</strong>estable</p>

<p><strong><em>Are there tools that can guide you how to convert the idea of web app (or mobile app) into a list of stories/iterations in a successful way?</em></strong> </p>

<p><strong><em>Some kind of visual representation of states, features or functions (and its relationships) where you can specified functional, non-functinal and technical specs, so after that you can create stories?</em></strong></p>

<p>These tools provide rich text editors that help us write the stories. Sometimes you have a requirement that doesn't fit as a story</p>

<ul>
<li>A use-case</li>
<li>User interface guidelines</li>
<li>A list of business rules etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then write something else. Tools like JIRA provide provision for attachments.</p>

<p><strong><em>so after that you can create stories?</em></strong></p>

  <p>Stories represent requirements, they do not document them. - Rachel

<hr>

<p><strong>Agile approach encourages <em>just enough architecture</em> with <em>continuous refactoring</em>.</strong></p>

<p>The sprint delivery team generally includes all the necessary stake holders like business analyst, tester, architect, dba, developers. They collectively are responsible completion of a story/sprint and at the end of the spring, you would have a production ready deployable application. Idea is to incrementally add features.</p>

<p>As you can see from the team composition architect/lead are also involved in each sprint. He, with the help of the team will architect and design just for the stories that are part of the current sprint/iteration (<a href=""http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2010/201011/201011-Fairbanks.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Just enough architecture</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_Design"" rel=""noreferrer"">Emergent Design</a>). The stories they pick for first sprint are either high risk or architecturally significant ones. </p>

<p>When it comes to design, mostly it is brainstorming and paper or black board based. Idea is to use code as the reference documentation as much as possible and build collective knowledge across the team by pair programming etc etc. </p>

<p>So you wouldn't end up with a poor quality software. You would in fact have the minimum code base that can exercise the stories (you are not accumulating code base for future requirements or nice to have features). Somewhere I read that only 40% of the features built are every used by customers.</p>
