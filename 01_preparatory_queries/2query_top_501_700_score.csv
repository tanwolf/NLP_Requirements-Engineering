"8799935","Requirements for TFS automated build and publish","<p>I'm new to TFS and we're trying to automate the test / build / deploy process for our builds.</p>

<p>The problem I'm experiencing is that when I try to start a build with automatic deployment (for a webpage) using the MSBuild Arguments it complains that it doesn't have the necessary DLLs and I've figured out so far that they get installed with Visual Studio Premium or Ultimate, but then other people complained that something like Visual Studio shouldn't get installed on a Server =)</p>

<p>The TFS is also the build server for now and I'd like the know if there are any known requirements for these things to work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated UI Testing</li>
<li>Automated deployment</li>
<li>Automated publish</li>
<li>Code Analysis</li>

","<tfs><build-automation><requirements><msdeploy><automated-deploy>","2012-01-10 07:33:34","1423","1","2","8800651","<p>The way we handle that on my team is to actually check all the references needed to build the product in to source control.  Anything beyond the .NET framework itself, and whatever you get for installing a build controller/build agent, gets checked in..  </p>

<p>Positive bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting up a build agent is trivial (just ""Install Server 2K8R2, install build agent, start building"").  </li>
<li>Don't have to worry about complicated SDK installation to match people's dev boxes..  References are all the exact version checked in to source control.</li>
<li>You get <em>binary</em> version control, which means if you need to do a maintenance release and build against last year's version of a particular API, it's super easy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Negative bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bloats your source control a bit</li>
<li>Feels weird checking binaries in to source control</li>
<li>Need to be <em>very</em> vigilant about maintaining structure and cleanliness of how you check in the binaries, otherwise it can easily get out of control</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, as far as making the test bits work from your build agent..  Probably the easiest way would be to install the <em>test</em> agent.  The UI automation stuff in VS2010 is the ""CodedUI Test"" framework..  It extends the normal VS Unit Test framework, but requires some additional registrations to work.  </p>

<p>More complicated, but super useful longer term is to set up the full ""Visual Studio Lab Management"" platform.  Downside is, to fully leverage it you'll need to hook up a System Center Virtual Machine Manager server and at least one Hyper-V host, and build out a virtual machine with a ""Clean"" VM snapshot (everything <em>except</em> the product you're testing installed).  Once all that's in place you get a <em>really</em> slick end-to-end build-deploy-test experience..  You trigger the product build via the build system, once that completes your environment is restored to that absolutely clean state (no worries about leftover bits from last version corrupting your testing, etc), the product gets published to this test environment, and then it executes your tests.</p>

<p>Not sure if you're using TFS for workitem tracking, testcase management, project planning, and whatnot..  If not, the lab management stuff may be too heavy-weight to mess with.  More info <a href=""http://vsarlabman.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> if you're interested in messing with that part.  :)</p>

"8368237","How to determine the minimum JRE version and system requirements for my Java application","<p>I have written an application in Java using Eclipse IDE and I now need to know the minimum JRE version that is required to run the application! I know that certain methods are only available under later JREs, but I was wondering what the easiest way to find out the highest requirement of my application would be, so any suggestions would be appreciated...</p>

<p>Also whilst I am on the topic of requirements, I would appreciate any advice or methods for determining the minimum system requirements for my software in general - i.e minimum amount of RAM...</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
","<eclipse><java><requirements><system-requirements>","2011-12-03 14:12:12","8559","17","1","8368294","<ul>
<li><strong>Method 1:</strong> For minimum JRE version, that's going to be tough. The easiest way is to simply require the same version that you're building against, or later, e.g. JRE 6.x.x or higher.</li>
<li><strong>Method 2:</strong> Install multiple JDK's, making them available in Eclipse, and just change the version you're building against, running your app's test suite each time, and making sure they all pass. The earliest version of the JDK that allows all your tests to pass is the lowest JRE it can run against. <strong>Simply having your app successfully compile isn't enough</strong>, because previous versions of the JRE/JDK might have bugs that allow for successful compilation, but <strong>don't</strong> allow for proper program execution.</li>
<li><strong>Method 3:</strong> Always require the latest on the client side, because Oracle is constantly patching security holes, and ultimately, it may be best to require the latest versions, if you have that kind of control, on the client side.</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as RAM, that's easy. When the JVM starts it sets a 'maximum' amount of RAM (I believe the default may be 128MB), and that's a hard limit that your application cannot exceed without crashing. Profile your app over time, tweaking the memory settings on the JVM, and find out what the minimum amount of RAM is that you'll need for your app to run both (a) with acceptable performance, and (b)  without throwing an <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/OutOfMemoryError.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">OutOfMemoryError</a>, and you're done.</p>

<p>Ref: <a href=""http://wiki.customware.net/repository/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=35389482"" rel=""noreferrer"">How to configure JVM options and memory?</a></p>

<p>For other requirements such as CPU req., things get a little fuzzier. There are a lot of CPUs out there, and the throughput that a given system produces can vary not just based on CPU speed, but the speed of the hard drive, the amount of RAM installed in the system, the speed of the network interface (if you're writing a network app), and other things. For requirements such as that, you'll want to just test it on a variety of systems and sort of draw a line somewhere, and say, ""You can expect acceptable performance if you have hardware that is at least as powerful as X, Y, Z"".</p>

<p>The other thing you could do is build in a benchmark, or some kind of performance logging, and have that performance data sent back to you. Lots of apps do this. You know that ""May we send anonymous usage data back to the mothership?"" question you get when installing some software? Well, common among that data are system-specific details such as RAM, CPU, hard drive model, and other hardware details (whatever data you determine is relevant to your app), along with performance logging data. By taking that kind of approach, what you get is a lot of performance data from lots of different system configurations without needing to have a huge number of differently configured machines in-house.</p>

<p>You can do the same thing for program crashes and bugs - have the stack traces, system info, and other relevant data dumped to a log file that is sent back to you - but of course, <strong>only if your users have said it's okay</strong> to send that data back to you.</p>

<ul>
<li>When you download Xcode (or more precisely the ""Developer Tools"" package), it includes Xcode and a lot of other tools (Instruments, gcc, gdb, llvm, lldb, the iOS Simulator, ...) and <strong>also the latest version of the MacOS and iOS SDKs</strong> too.</li>
<li>The <strong>version and size are mentionned on the download page too</strong> (version of Xcode, of the iOS SDK, of the Mac SDK,... everything). Right now (oct. '11) it is <strong>Xcode 4.2, iOS 5.0 SDK and OSX 10.7 SDK</strong>. Everything come in one package (<strong>1.65Go</strong> for the latest version as of today) <em>except the documentation, which is downloaded automatically by Xcode itself (unless disabled) in the background.</em></li>
<li>For the requirements, it is also described in the iOS Dev Center: Xcode4 is available for <strong>both Snow Leopard</strong> (on the iOS Dev Center) <strong>and Lion</strong> (via the Mac AppStore) right now.</li>
<li>When you submit your app, you normally should <strong>always submit it using the latest SDK</strong> (1). <em>[EDIT after @progrmr comment] except of course for beta versions of the SDK. Alsways submit with the latest ""release""/public SDK version]</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that using the latest SDK does not mean that you need to stop supporting and testing for previous iOS versions. You can use the iOS 5.0 SDK and publish an app that is running on iOS4.x for example (and of course it is better if it still works on iOS5.x too); ascendant compatibility is generally guaranteed, unless specified for specific methods (see the ""SDK Compatibility Programming Guide"" in the Apple Doc for more info).</p>

<p><em>(1) It is generally accepted if you submit with the SDK version just before the latest if it is not too old, Apple let you some time to migrate, but this is generally just a transition phase. It is advised and a good practice to migrate to the latest SDK when it is available -- or not too late after that.</em></p>

<li>XCode 4.2 is about 1.8gb, and that doesn't include documentation - when you first load XCode it tries to download something like 2-2.5gb of docs in the background. You have to both cancel the download and the auto update check to avoid that (but auto updating docs <em>is</em> cool).</li>
<li>I don't recall any requirement to use the latest and greatest, you can still download XCode 3 with iOS SDK 4.3 from the archives. But I can't say for sure, I always run the latest (I find upgrading to new XCode releases is generally a good idea).</li>
<li>XCode is available for Snow Leopard once you buy the $99/yr iOS developer subscription, the mac app store has it but only for Lion. The advantage of the MAS version is you can play with the SDK and making basic apps for free, just not run code on your iOS device.</li>

Now the question that I'm faced with is whether I should write up tests for these other formats or should I wait until I actually implement those features? This question hits at something a bit more fundamental about TDD which I would like to ask more broadly.</p>

<p>Can/should tests be written up front as soon as requirements are known or should the degree of stability of the requirements somehow determine whether a test should be written or not?</p>

<p>More generally, how far in advance should tests be written? Is it OK to write a test that will fail for two years until the that feature is slated to be implemented?

<p>Failing tests are noise. If you have failing tests that you know fail, it will be much harder for you to notice that another (legitimate) failure has snuck in. If you strive to always have all your tests pass, then even <em>one</em> failing test is a big warning sign -- it tells you it's time to drop everything and fix that bug. But if you always say ""oh, it's fine, we always have a few hundred failing tests"", then when real bugs slip in, you don't notice. You're negating the primary benefit of having tests.</p>

<p>Besides, it's silly to write tests now for something you won't work on for years. You're delaying the stuff you should be working on now, and you're wasting work if those future features get cut.</p>

Now the question that I'm faced with is whether I should write up tests for these other formats or should I wait until I actually implement those features? This question hits at something a bit more fundamental about TDD which I would like to ask more broadly.</p>

<p>Can/should tests be written up front as soon as requirements are known or should the degree of stability of the requirements somehow determine whether a test should be written or not?</p>

<p>More generally, how far in advance should tests be written? Is it OK to write a test that will fail for two years until the that feature is slated to be implemented? If so then how would one organize their tests to separate tests that are required to pass versus those that are not <em>yet</em> required to pass? I'm currently using NUnit for a .NET project so I don't mind specifics since they may better demonstrate how to accomplish such organization.</p>

We usually enforced them in the structural design such as as DB constraint in your case.</p>

<p>Business requirements deals with what the business perceives in order to make the app acceptable. In most cases, but not all, this usually involves how the ROI is generated from the program that we develop. In our projects, the demographic info is usually tied to some kind of marketing campaign, a data that can be used later to promote things to the users, or something similar.</p>

<p>I find that business people normally do not adequately explain to us the necessity of business requirements and simply stating them as ""required"". Just stating that without having us understand the context is making it hard for us to determine how it should be implemented. If we know that the business requirements are core to the business and the company may lose a lot if we don't implement it correctly then obviously we would choose a more fail safe way to implement it. In your case, that would probably by embedding it in the structural constraint itself.</p>

<p>In order to answer your question, it's important to understand the context and the needs of the business requirements that are proposed by the business/pm.

","<requirements><business-logic><constraints>","2011-09-01 21:46:26","364","0","5","7280283","<p>By putting these constraints in the database, you are asking the database to help enforce your business logic. There are good reasons for enforcing such constraints in the database.</p>

<ol>
<li>The database is your reference. It needs to be as correct as
possible. Putting not null constraints in the database helps that.
It enforces some of the business rules even if it is not the front
end GUI that is inserting the data, for example bulk inserts from a
batch or a developer/dba changing the data using SQL to 'fix' a
problem.</li>
<li>It does actually help the developer to understand the data constraints. Digging through code to find out if a value cannot be null is sometimes a bit difficult, but looking at the db is easy. Similarly, if you're producing reports and you know that a column is not null, then it becomes easier.</li>
<li>If you KNOW that a value should not be null and it is an error if it is null, this allows fail-fast behaviour. If anyone inserts a null value without going through the business logic, or due to a bug, then the bug will be found quicker than if you allowed nulls in the database.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ask yourself the question: would you remove foreign key constraints as well? After all, they are only business constraints. You can enforce them through business logic after all.</p>

<p>The question for me is how many constraints to put in the database. As a general rule, I create two types of constraints in the database: foreign keys and not null constraints. These are quick wins, and uncontroversial. For your point about duplication of code, you're correct, you are theoretically duplicating a check, but the benefits outweigh any minor problems. So I put checks in the business logic AND I add a not-null constraint in the database.</p>

<p>You can go further with different types of check constraint, but that's normally not the case for me, because now you're really starting to duplicate code.</p>

<p>Enforcing foreign key and not-null constraints in the database isn't a perfect or complete system, but it does find bugs, it protects your data, and it helps you with your job.</p>

<p>I'd be extremely grateful for a point in the right direction. I've got a small script for the screen res already and I've been looking into Hyperic SIGAR for much of the rest (except the bandwidth stuff).</p>

  <p>Is an applet the right direction?</p>

<p>Possibly yes, the only other alternative in Java, to run Java classes on a client machine, from a web site is to use Java Web Start (JWS). You can investigate both, and decide on one. I would recommend looking at JWS primarily because</p>

<ul>
<li>The SIGAR DLLs (or any other native libraries) would have to be present in the ""java.library.path"" location of the client machine. If your native libraries are contained within applets, then you'll need to write these to disk first, before loading them.</li>
<li>JWS allows you to embed native libraries in a JAR. The <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/javaws/developersguide/syntax.html#resources"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>nativelib</code></a> element of the JNLP file, can be used to specify the JAR that contains the SIGAR libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>As noted in the comment, you will need to sign your code. See this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5430105/signed-applets-jni-and-dlls"">related question</a> on StackOverflow as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is Java the right/best language? (this will be all done through a web page)</p>

<p>That depends on how much information you need from the client machines, and how diverse they are; if they are all running Windows, see the footnote. Flash supports checking <a href=""http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/system/Capabilities.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">system capabilities</a>, but to a limited extent: Processor speed and Available memory detection might not be possible in Flash.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm not aware of the equivalent system capability detection features in .Net (and/or ActiveX), although you could be fairly certain that they would exist. You might want to ask another question, to discover whether this is possible and how feasible it would be.</p>

"6165775","How to write technical requirements","<p>What is the right way to write technical requirements for the UI component in an application? I guess it's not clear to me whether the technical requirement should dictate how the UI should be implemented or it should be as general as possible and describe what are required to satisfy the functional requirements and forget about the implementation details. </p>

<p>Here are my specific questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should it state what technology the UI will be implemented in? (eg, ActiveX, WPF, HTML). </p></li>
<li><p>Should I describe the layout, the colors? (given that that can change)</p></li>
<li><p>Is it necessary to describe how the data is presented? (eg, does it need to say ""data is displayed in a table or list format"" or ""a scrollbar shall appear is data cannot be fit on the screen""?)</p></li>
<li><p>Do I need to describe how the UI should react to user input if that is a functional requirement? (eg, the functional requirement says ""it shall be clear to the user which action is current active""... should the technical requirement say ""the button shall change color to Red when user selects option a.. Blue when user selects option b.. etc"")</p></li>
<li><p>Is it necessary to state things that are common sense about the UI? For example,""it shall be position in such a way the entire content is visible""? or ""it shall have shadow so that it stands out from the rest of the screen""? (note: these are not functional requirements but they apply to any UI in general)</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If the person writing the requirements is the technical lead, then it may well dictate the technology choice. </li>
<li>If however the person writing the requirements is a non-technical manager, then it's generally in the best interest to let the technical team decide on specifics while the manager merely dictates specific requirements that must be implemented.</li>
<li>Additionally, things like layout and colors probably don't have a place in technical requirements. Someone (whether it's the development team, or if available, a designer) should come up with mockups or wireframes to review with the users. This is an iterative process and can usually be done in parallel with some of the initial development (ie. developers can usually start writing domain models, database schemas, etc. while the designer iterates the UI with the users/stakeholders).</li>
<li>IMO, obvious things should be left out as they are just clutter, however, business rules such as validation, and screen states should absolutely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, I want to reitorate that it entirely depends on the makeup of the team. The requirements doc is meant to communicate from one tier to another. And all decisions should be left to the tier best equipped to make those decisions.</p>

"5811048","Can I create hierarchial Requirements document using TFS query or TFS Report","<p>I am exploring feasibility of using TFS for software process on our next project.  One need is to be able to create a requirements document from individual linked requirements within TFS.  I've currently got mock-up projects in both Agile and CMMI with a set of requirements linked with parent child relationships.  I can query these requirements in both Agile and CMMI but the result doesn't show the hierarchy.  With CMMI I can run the report ""Project Management::Requirements Progress"" which shows requirement titles with indention based on hierarchy. It doesn't however show the detailed descriptions</p>

<p>What I'd like is to auto generate a Word document with hierarchical headings based on TFS requirement work items and their parent/child relationships.</p>

<p>Also to generate rich text and drawings from the TFS requirement Work Item descriptions.  So a secondary question is how to change the description field in the Requirements Work Item to support rich text so that the reports can use it. If I try to edit the <em>Task</em> Work Item Description field it warns me that continuing to save may make file unloadable.</p>
","<tfs><hyperlink><report><requirements>","2011-04-27 21:50:58","1121","3","1","5884193","<p>To support RichText in your work items you need to edit your work item definition by Work Item Editor wihch can be found in the TFS Power Tools thingy. You should add a new custom rich text field and use that field for your descriptions. (The downside is, Excel plug-in does not support editing richtext fields.They are read-only in Excel)</p>

<p>For printing work items, I had to improvise solution and worked pretty well for me. I used the ""Mail Merge"" functionality of MS Word and designed a word document. After that I prepared a SQL query that takes the needed field values from TFS Warehouse. Rest is done by MS Word. Mail Merge prepares a single document for each work item record. They are separate documents but it does the trick I suppose.</p>

<p>For creating a hierarchy I think you need to go a little deeper. Since TFS supports parent/child relationships but does not follow any particular sort order, I suppose another custom field is needed. You can either use the field to give hierarchy tokens manually (1.1, 1.2, etc.) or you can develop a little custom command line utility to traverse the work item tree and autoset values for the mentioned custom field.</p>

<p>Now I would like to link the Requirements Work Item to the source code file with the tests.

One of the reasons for this is that a source file might implement many requirements, tasks and bug fixes over time. You want to associate the changes to the file to a work item, not the file itself. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jjM7u.png"" alt=""TFS Checkin dialogue""></p>

<p>A requirement (or bug fix or task) might involve changes to multiple files so you should checkin files in logical groups. I.e. if you've changed 3 source files and a config file to fix a bug then you can check those files in separately and associate the changes to the bug work item at each checkin. You could also check in all 4 files at the same time and associate that single checkin to the work item. </p>

<p>If you change 3 source files and a config file to fix a bug, and you have also changed another source file to add extra functionality, you should avoid checking this file in with the others as it will be held in the same changeset and associated with the same work items as the bug fix code. </p>

<p>In your specific case, if the requirements change then I think you should probably create a new work item. That way you can see the code that implemented the original requirement and the changes to the file will be associated to the change in requirements.</p>

<p>""Will it scale?"" Now that is the question a lot of us wonder about SQL Azure. Especially since you can't tell it how much Ram, CPU Cores or replicated servers with load balancing to allocate. With Windows Azure you can tell it how many of each resource you want your application hosted on, but that isn't the case with SQL Azure. This may sound really bad to some, but SQL Azure is designed to ""automagically"" scale the database server to your needs. What that means I honestly can't say, as I haven't (as of yet) found much official information from Microsoft on that topic.</p>

<p>With extremely high traffic sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, it has been suggested that non-relational databases (such as Azure Table Storage) can scale better since the database has less overhead when querying data. If you need relational database features (such as foreign key relationships and sql join functionality) then you probably want to use SQL Azure.</p>

<p>It's not as clear cut as ""to SQL Azure, or not to SQL Azure."" There are database architecture design patterns that can be used such as denormalizing database tables (require less joins per query) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_%28database%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Horizontally Partitioning</a> your data to allow your design to better scale.</p>

<p>A Hybrid or Mixed solution of both SQL Azure and Azure Table Storage can be used too. If you have some data that requires relational queries, then put it in SQL Azure. If you have data that does not require a relational database, then you could put it in Azure Table Storage.</p>

<p>Remember, the database design is part of the overall architecture of your application and you should plan it out just as much as you plan whether to use TDD, IOC and Dependency Injection. After all, if your database can't scale, it doesn't matter how awesome the application code is.</p>

<p>Aside, Thinking about this topic makes me wonder what XBox Live and Bing Search use for their database needs. Is it Relational, Non-Relational or Hybrid?</p>

But it is best to develop with a larger capacity and decide on final parts when your software nears completion, because its easier to omit components than to try and find room for them later. This kind of design can be an iterative process, start with one estimate and see if a prototype works, don't commit to volumes until you are nearly at the end.</p>

<p>In the case of an LCD based product, you will have two major components using up flash memory, the code and the LCD data (character strings, bitmaps etc). Its certainly easier to estimate the LCD data than the code, which depends on functionality, compiler optimisations etc. If you are bringing in external libraries then at least you already have code for them.</p>

<p>In any case, have an upgrade plan. The worst thing is to run out of capacity at the end of the project and be struggling to optimise the last feature/debug solution in without adding another problem. Make sure you know what the next size up chips are and how you can get them to fit, sometimes a PCB can be designed to take various different chips in the same position. Or have an expandable system, where you can plug things into a memory bus.</p>

<p>15,000,000 visits a month means 700K visits a day (assuming approx 30-35% visits are by repeat visitors).</p>

<p>700Kx5=3.5million page views a day. 
Assuming 14 hours of active period, typical for single timezeone sites. Its 70reqs/sec.</p>

<p>With this big userbase few thing you surely need is a high performance DB server, with one slave.
Config of these DB server</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Memory so that whole active data + indexes fits in memory (No swapping/thrashing should happen). This you need to calculate based on
  what you will be storing for user and for how long.</li>
  <li>Use some reliable storage like RAID10 (higher read/write bandwith). </li>
  <li>Take enough storage, see that its elastic enough. (like AWS EBS).</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Make frontend app server lightweight and horizontally scalable. Put them behind a loadbalancer (use software loadbalancer like nginx or HAproxy). You should be able to put as many as you go to your goal.</p>

<p>For <code>loadbalacer and frontend take 4CPU, 4-8GB RAM servers</code>.
How much each frontend can take need to be tested using a load testing method and realistic test data.</p>

<p>Reduce load on database/persistent using a inmemory/+persistent caches like memcached/membase/redis etc. Take a servers with 8GB and add more as you feel need. </p>

<p>I have not discussed about DB partitioning. Do that only when you feel the need of it. Do not over invest at start. </p>

<p>With 15M users a month, this setup should be enough, <code>but again it all depends on you 1. memory footprint, 2. amount of active data</code> </p>

","<concurrency><requirements>","2011-02-20 11:15:05","10875","3","2","5066820","<p>Assuming you're talking about a web application (based on your desire to estimate ""hits"" per second), you have to work on a number of assumptions.
- How long will a user spend between interactions? For typical content pages, that might be 10 seconds; for interactive web apps, perhaps only 5 seconds.
- Divide the number of users by the ""think time"" to get hits per second - 200 concurrent users with a think time of 10 seconds gives you 20 concurrent users on average.
- Then multiply by a ""peak multiplier"" - most web sites are relatively silent during the night, but really busy around 7PM. So your average number needs to take account of that - typically, I recommend a peak of between 4 and 10 times. 
This gives you a peak page requests per second - this is usually the limiting factor for web applications (though by no means always - streaming video is often constrained by bandwidth, for instance).
If you really want to know ""hits"", you then need to work through the following:
- How many assets on your page? Images, stylesheets, javascript files etc. - ""hit"" typically refers to any kind of request, not just the HTML page (or ASPX or PHP or whatever). Most modern web apps include dozens of assets.
- How cacheable are your pages and/or assets? Most images, CSS, JS files etc. should be set to cacheable by the browser. </p>

<p>Multiply the page requests by the number of non-cacheable assets. Add to this the number of visitors multiplied by the number of assets if you want to be super precise.</p>

<p>All of this usually means you have to make lots and lots of assumptions - so the final number is an indicator at best. For scalability measurements, I usually spend more time trying to understand the bottlenecks in the system and observing the system under load.</p>

<p>If space is a constraint, then separate table will be better. On the other hand, if performance is a criteria, then you'll have to take into account how many times that field is queried and whether it is checked for existence or non-existence.

However it's worth a warning: there isn't a single, agreed definition for what each type of requirement is, so I've given a definition for you I've chosen for each case.</p>

<p>I'm sure all of these can be improved in one way or another, but I feel these are decent requirements. </p>

<h2>User Requirements</h2>

<p><em>High level requirements that describe what a user can achieve. These are the needs that the system fulfil, similar to business requirements</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>U1.</strong> Users can post a textual update of their current mood or status. </li>
<li><strong>U2.</strong> Users can choose whether the post described in U1 is shared with Friends, Everyone, or Nobody other than themselves.</li>
<li><strong>U3.</strong> Users are presented with a list of posts made by people they are friends with or posts that are made to Everyone (see U2).</li>
<li><strong>U4.</strong> The posts that appear in the lists U3 are filtered to only contain those that the user will find relevant or interesting</li>
<li><strong>U5.</strong> The posts that appear in the lists U3 are ordered so that those the user will find highly relevant, and have not been seen previously by the user are towards the top of the list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Function Requirements</h2>

<p><em>Functional requirements provide highly specific details that allow designers, developers and testers to create a system to meets precise specifications. I've mapped them to user requirements from above</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>F1.</strong> Posts can be 63,206 characters long. [ref U1]</li>
<li><strong>F2.</strong> Posts can be contain unicode characters. [ref U1] </li>
<li><strong>F3.</strong> Posts may not contain any any of the following formatting, other than what can be provided by unicode characters - bold, strikethrough, underline [ref U1]</li>
<li><strong>F4.</strong> 80% or more of posts in a users' post list (U3) should be from their friends. The remaining posts can be public posts or sponsored posts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Non Functional Requirements</h2>

<p><em>qualities and characteristics of the system that are not features. Again can be mapped to user or functional requirements</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>N1</strong>. After submitting a post through the web interface (see U1), it will be available to appear to in other users' lists of posts (see U3) within 30 seconds for 90% of posts.</li>
<li><strong>N2</strong>. An update to a users list of posts (either the initial view of a list, or an extension to the list when scrolling to the bottom) appears in 3 seconds for 90% of users. </li>
<li><strong>N3</strong>. 50% of users can post a status update within 1 minute of starting to try and post without having used the application before or receiving help.</li>
</ul>

I could implement them at my code too, but it seems just to be a poor quick fix.</p>

<p>If i can illustrate, one function of my system is that it must implement a user hierarchy. </p>

  <p>Where do you draw the line between functional requirements and aspects of design?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Requirements is what the code needs to do. Design gets into how it will do it, with class hierarchies, design patterns used, etc. </p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There must be A, B, and C types of
  user. Type A is only able to edit
  their own account, type B can edit
  their own account and post to hidden
  forums, type C can edit all accounts
  and post to all forums. The application must have a small memory footprint because blah blah blah....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Design:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each instance of the user class will
  contain a member variable of a
  permissions object. The permissions
  object is a wrapper for a bit field
  because memory is tight, but has
  several convenience methods, called
  foo, bar, and baz. foo does XXX and is
  public, (eventually design gets very low level and is turned
  into code).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not saying that would be the actual design, but that's how the design should analyze the requirements and eventually become a working implementation.</p>

Explain them, that by using use cases you can earn time by dropping features, which will potentially end up on the ""never used"" pile. With use cases you can find out what are the features customers need and will pay for and by removing unimportant features out of the scope you would have time to implement. Use cases apart from defining the scope also help to identify all the stakeholders, which might help you to focus even better while defining the scope and prevent forgetting about trivial things, which are not so apparent, but are a must if the product should be usable. The third most important thing about use cases is that they allow you to start thinking about corner cases which might be important for the customer before development and therefore you can find out with the customer what would be the ideal solution instead of letting the coder decide on his/her own under pressure of deadline.</p>

<p>For me, the aspect of traceability from requirements to test cases is a way to ensure that all functional requirements are accounted for and everything works in the right way. If you lose traceability somewhere along the way, this means that you have some requirement, for which you may not be able to tell where in the design it is satisfied. And if you can tell where in the design your requirement is accounted for, but you have no test case traced to that, then it simply means you've missed out on testing this requirement.</p>

<p>So in summary, this kind of traceability ensures your test cases cover all of your functional requirements. Nevertheless, you can have more test-cases, as well as more (non-functional) requirements.</p>

<p>I think the distinction just signifies when they are produced, and for what purpose. Requirements are produced very early before we know a lot of implementation specific details. We try to keep them implementation neutral so they tend to be more abstract. </p>

<p>The purpose of test scripts is somewhat different. Requirements tell developers what the system should do, not how to do it. Test cases however (as they are often written) specify exactly how to do something and they will often reference the actual implementation details. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If test cases are not requirements and require more than the documented requirements (e.g. testing more errors, etc) then surely the requirements set is incomplete? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there requirements set is incomplete. It always is because you can never completely document all expectation of all users or stakeholder no matter how long you work at it.</p>

<p>But then the test cases are also incomplete. Complete testing is impossible. Any set of tests is a sample set of all potential tests. However, the tests are typically done at a later stage, when we know much more about the requirements, and so they can be more specific, more detailed, and more complete, not not fully complete.</p>

<p>Take a look at:
<a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/04/r-3217/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/04/r-3217/</a></p>

<p>In this article, the author explains how to get from use cases to test cases. The point the author makes is that while the use case contain all the flow and sub flows, the test cases are the specific data and the specific flow through the system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are requirements just abstract test cases?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say yes, they can be viewed that way. Some people would even go as far as to not write test  cases, and just use the requirements as a 'checklist' on which to base their testing.</p>

<p>Traceability from test cases to requirements is a very nice idea and is a very popular approach. Tools implement this feature because it sells. But there are limitations and traps with this approach. There is often a false sense of completeness when the tool happily reports 100% coverage because you happen to have 1 test for every requirement. It's doesn't really address the problem that some requirements require much more than just one test. It also does not factor in the content of the tests or whether the tests actually cover what they should.</p>

<p>If you are interested in Requirements->Test traceability, you should be aware of the limitations of the approach, and realize that it should be used carefully in combination with other approaches to give a more comprehensive approach to your testing.</p>

I have not tried something exactly similar but when I was a Scrum Master of my Team we did have a project wide architectural guideline and vision (which all teams were a part of), which we reminded ourselves of, during the various inspect and adapt points of a Sprint and also the Scrum Project, like during Retrospectives, Sprint Planning meetings and even Daily Scrum meetings. Some ways we used to remind us were by adding Done Criterias for tasks which included one principle to follow architectural guidelines, and it could also be added as a small note in Backlogs. In my suggestion below I have mentioned how this was looked at from a really high level.</p>

<p>Do you discourage it for any reason? No not at all. I say your suggestion is good and you should try it for a planning meeting. And as suggested by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in their Scrum Guide, you should inspect and adapt during the 3 points in a Sprint - ""There are three points for inspection and adaptation in Scrum. The Daily Scrum meeting is used to inspect progress toward the Sprint goal, and to make adaptations that optimize the value of the next work day. In addition, the Sprint Review and Planning meetings are used to inspect progress toward the Release Goal and to make adaptations that optimize the value of the next Sprint. Finally, the Sprint Retrospective is used to review the past Sprint and determine what adaptations will make the next Sprint more productive, fulfilling, and enjoyable.""</p>

<p>Have you any suggestion on this matter? Is it safe for me to assume that this 'Agile' project in your company is just getting started and you don't have a project solid vision set yet? If yes, I would suggest you arrange a 2 week project wide release planning workshop. The purpose of this workshop would be get all the stakeholders, POs , SMs and Project Managers in single location and develop a Super User Story and Vision, and the rest of the Backlogs broken down from the super User Story.The Super User Story would be the high level vision of the project goal. If you have already done this then please ignore this suggestion BUT my point of bringing this up is that the high level vision or super user story could/should have a part which mentions following the architectural principle set in your company.</p>

<p>Advantages of this? It gets the stakeholder involved in the architectural and technical aspect of the product right from the Super User Story which helps create good understanding of the vision between the business and the technical side, and one cannot live without the other.</p>

<p>I may have intentionally tried to extend the answer beyond the questions scope so that I may get some feedback on my ideas as well.</p>

<p>A good requirements specification will give all stakeholders the same picture of the software to be developed and can help resolve contractual issues later.  Consult references on software requirements if needed (Software Requirements by Karl Wiegers is a good source).  Be sure it is accurate and kept current--you will rely on this if the client feels the software is not complete and refuses to pay.</p>

<p>Software:</p>

<p>Get a rough idea of the work to be done  (or if you have a complete spec, even better) and the development language. Of the requirements listed in the spec, determine which are supported by the language and which aren't.  Decide if you will need to buy third-party libraries to complete the unsupported requirements (user interface controls, etc.).  You will likely want to include the price for this in the contract.  You don't want to get stuck paying the bill for these unless you think you can reuse them in other projects.</p>

<p>Also consider development software, database software, etc.  For testing on different system configurations, virtualization software with operating systems licenses will be helpful.  </p>

<p>People:</p>

<p>Having extra programmers can help, but adding a programmer does not double the output, especially if they are inexperienced and require your assistance.  As your team grows, it becomes more important to have well-written requirements and a thought-out design to keep everyone on the same page.

<p>Someone dedicated to writing documents (user manuals, help pages, some technical specs) can be useful.  If a lot of documentation is required, this might be worth considering, since it will allow you to focus on what you do best.  I have never had a technical writer work with me, but I would really like to try this and see if it pays off.</p>

<p>For example, select a technical topic the candidate knows well and ask them to describe, in detail, some aspect of the topic. Listen to how precisely they choose their descriptions and how appropriate the words they are choosing actually are. Requirements documents are often implemented literally by developers so it's critical that the terms and words the writers are using be the correct terms. ""Words have meanings"" - use them correctly. :)</p>

<p>Something else to listen for is the frequent use of generic, vague, or broad terms. Translated into a requirements document, this will lead to confusion, conflicts in requirements, and time wasted to clarify. Most companies have a common diction or 'lingo' that req. writers are expected to learn, but if you lack the discipline to learn and use descriptions correctly, then it will do your writing no good.</p>

<p>Finally, during the conversation, ask clarifying questions and observe if their response is just a rephrased version of what they originally said, or if they change gears and clarify using a new angle. Because we don't all see things the same way, the ability to rephrase a concept to be more understandable to a specific listener is very helpful for clarification sessions. In an interview or discussion, <strong>you</strong> are the listener and a good requirements writer should be able to help you understand what they are saying.</p>

<p>I would definitely take into consideration how the person takes a simple problem statement and develops it into a set of requirements and perhaps prioritizes them.</p>

<p>You can take something as simple as a pen. The problem statement could be that ""I need something to write with on paper, while I take notes in a meeting"". For this problem statement you could come up with a variety of requirements, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tool used must be able to leave a persistent mark on paper</li>
<li>It must not tear through paper when I write fast</li>
<li>The user must be able to write with it for extended periods of time (this really means that the grip must be comfortable, it must be light-weight, but heavy enough to maintain the feel)</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ul>

<p>For a requirements person, they must be able to distill requirements out of abstract use cases, and ask lots of questions too. Hope it helps. Goof luck!</p>

","<agile><scrum><requirements>","2010-08-18 16:14:26","2520","3","6","3517101","<p>The simple answer is: we don't, as keeping track of the changes doesn't usually make much sense or bring any benefits. </p>

<p>However, if for any reason you must keep track of changes (like wasteful overhead forced upon you by ""regulations"" - not unheard of, right?) the best thing to do is to keep your backlog in such a way that you would be able to tell how and when it did change. This is where scrum software tools can help, as doing it with a board and index cards would be a major pain. Sometimes just a simple history of all changes to any backlog item (like what we have in <A HREF=""http://www.bananascrum.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">our Scrum tool</a>) will suffice, sometimes you will need more complex reporting (available in some more complex tools), and sometimes you will have to produce some additional documents. </p>

<p>BTW - I understand ""a requirement"" to mean a single backlog item, usually a user story (or epic). As such those usually don't change a lot, their position on the backlog does, but usually not the stories themselves. Recording changes of stories position on the backlog doesn't make much sense in an agile project, however recording when stories were done (keeping data about past sprints) is a good practice. Recording changes to the story itself (edits, changes of attachments etc.) would be where the Scrum tool should help you if this is what you want/have to track.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An artifact is created to hold the business rule and is stored in some central repository of all the rules so this is known throughout the development team and a storehouse of knowledge is maintained.  This can get ugly as there can be hundreds of rules within just a few years of building out an application.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules may be put onto separate cards within the user story.  Thus, while the user story is that one line, there may be 6-8 cards that make up all the tasks for that story to be completed.  For example, there has to be a new patient form created, validation on the form, etc.  Thus, it isn't hard to see this crop up down the line on a card as a way to track the requirement that way.  This is the most natural to my mind though this isn't where the specific list is going to be 100% written down either as the card could be ""ensure some fields on the form are mandatory.""</p></li>
<li><p>There isn't an explicit link but rather the rule is something for QA or a BA to note for the user to verify that the form does enforce this rule.  This is similar to one but the question is what is the responsibility of the developer in this.  In this case, it is something for QA to track rather than developers possibly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The user story is intended to start a discussion, not be a comprehensive list of the requirements.  The rule is something that should come up when the developer discusses with the user what does it take to create a new patient file to my mind.</p>

<hr>

<p>I like the idea of hanging on to cards for a few sprints after the story was done, but I do see the point that the cards will ultimately be destroyed.  At the same time, there should be code somewhere that implements the rules in its proper area.  To use the example you posted, it may be that in a few places the list of required fields would be noticed as there is the UI layer that has to show the fields and probably an error message but also there should be some Business Logic Layer that has this logic to see that some fields were specifically completed before trying to create a new patient file.

<p>After completing all three from the first group and one from the second group the <code>USER</code> has completed that goal.  How would I go about <em>modeling this in PHP</em> so that the webapp knows the goal has been completed and how would I store the data in the database?</p>

<p><strong>To be clear</strong>, there will be many different types of goals like this, but all of them will be quite similar in nature.</p>
","<php><zend-framework><models><requirements><business-logic>","2010-08-04 03:04:20","137","4","1","3402370","<p>Assuming that <strong>A, B &amp; C</strong> and <strong>D, E, &amp; F</strong> will always belong to a specific group within the goal, I would design it thus:</p>

  {
    switch (Group::type())
    {
      case ""all"":
        TRUE if all complete

  }

  if all TRUE

}

<p>Or in English...     </p>

<p>You could then store all of your Activities within an Activities table and define the group they are a part of as a simple id reference to the Groups table. When an Activity is complete, it can be marked thus in the DB.</p>

<p>To check for completed goals, you simply need to look for each Group that is required for the Goal. Each group would either be ""all"" or ""any"" (or other such options, like ""min-2""), and this would tell the script what to check for with the Activity completions. Each Group can then return TRUE or FALSE depending upon its Activities. Assuming that all Groups are required, the Goal would then easily be identified as Complete or not.</p>

<p>The database can look like:</p>

<pre><code>Activities
- id
- group_id
- name
- completed
- [details about activitiy]

Groups
- id
- goal_id
- type  (ENUM: 'any', 'all')
- completed
- [details about group]

Goals
- id
- completed
- [details about goal]
</code></pre>

<p>The Completed values within Groups and Goals would need to be actively updated whenever Activities is updated, or left out and their values always dynamically worked out.</p>

Many ""modern"" graphic chipsets widely used in notebooks (yes, Intel, I'm looking at you) do not even fully support OpenGL 2.x; some even lack features as old as multisampling.</p>

<p>The only way to make your software run on as many systems as possible is to use things like <a href=""http://glew.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GLEW</a> to decide which features to use at runtime (i.e. no need for conditional compiling).</p>

<p>As far as learning OpenGL is concerned, 2.1 is definitely a good choice, because it enables you to understand both older code using the fixed-function pipeline and more modern code relying on shaders. Afterwards, getting to grips with the most important 3.x features (e.g. frame buffer objects, vertex array objects) will be rather easy.</p>
