<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Requirements have almost nothing to do with technical design.</p>

<p>Requirements define ""what"" must happen.  Design explains ""how"" it will be built to make that happen.</p>

<p>For instance, I want a beer -- that's my requirement.</p>

<p>Technical design could be </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get off my chair and walk downstairs.  Low cost.  There's a risk here.  There may be no beer.</p></li>
<li><p>Get off my chair and walk to the pub.  Higher cost. There's little risk here.  Except Sundays when it's closed.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask my wife.  Huge risk here. Possible unintended consequences.  However, I've delegated the problem and she now has to either find beer in the house, run to the store, or tell me to get my own.  If she's going out anyway, we're back to low cost and no risk. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>One requirement.  Multiple designs for solutions.  <strong>You can't work on both things in one step.</strong></p>

<p>You must document requirements (actors, use cases, conceptual data model, conceptual processing model)</p>

<p>You must then design a solution.  The solution may -- or may not -- involve creating new software.  </p>

<p>When studying requirements you often find situations where the users need to change the way they work.  Requirements can be met a number of ways.  </p>

<p>One person can both document the requirements and do the design.  But you must do them separately.  You must document the requirements in a way that they users understand and agree to the nature of the problem and what's required to declare the problem solved.  </p>

<p>Then -- separately -- you decide how best to optimize cost, risk, time-to-deliver, skills, available technology to offer some solutions to the problem.</p>

<p>The 'powers that be' suggest that I take over the requirements documentation and combine them with my efforts on technical design.</p>

","<architecture><project-management><requirements>","2009-07-29 23:41:06","953","0","7","1204157","<p>I do not have the opportunity to work in an agile team or scrum team, nor have I have the chance to apply them. I do a lot of one-off development work for customers for 1~3 months. But one thing that I have learnt when in this kind of environment is:</p>

<p><strong>Sign off with the customer every stage of the project.</strong></p>

<p>Which will answer your question as:
<strong>Never mix requirements with design document.</strong></p>

<p>Actually, it goes beyond that.</p>

<ol>
<li>First off, sign off the Scope of Work (SoW).</li>
<li>Then, sign off the Requirements.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have, in many times, seen unreasonable customers, who have ever changing requirements. However, they do not expect to pay for these changes. If not managed properly, project cost will greatly outweigh and exceed the project income.</p>

<p>Having a signed-off SoW protects you from out-of-scope requirements, eg. ""the vendor will install app xxx"", and all of a sudden, ""the client wants an entire PKI infrastructure installed to protect communication to app xxx"".</p>

<p>Having a signed-off requirements protects you from sudden and unreasonable requirements, following a similar case from above, ""there is no need to protect and encrypt communication to app xxx"".</p>

<p>Note that these are legal protection. It is still up to you to decide if a new requirement from the client should be done. It is still good however to stress that they are not in the requirements and are purely done out of good will.</p>

<p>Merging the design document into the main requirements document prevent you from signing off the requirements document. The customer will be extremely happy about this, but I think your development team will hate the possible crunch time.</p>

<p>I did see an alternative approach people have (but not on merging design with requirements).</p>

<p>Split up the requirements document into a main file with seperate appendix files. Keep important and concrete things in the requirements document. This allows you to sign off the requirements document, while allowing changes to the appendix be done at a later stage. We mostly use this approach for support documents as the appendix. It might work with design doc as an appendix, but I have not seen a design doc as an appendix.</p>

<p>Besides, in some projects, you might even want to sign off design doc before development starts. Or these design/requirements/SoW are delivery or milestone payment. </p>

<p>Really, try to avoid merging them.</p>

","<architecture><project-management><requirements>","2009-07-29 23:41:06","953","0","7","1206598","<p>Requirements refer to <strong>what</strong> needs to be done.
Technical design refers to <strong>how</strong> the requirements can be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>One disadvantage of combining them is
that, if you're a technical guy,
you'll try to influence the
requirements to make the technical
task easier, focusing on <strong>how</strong>. In
the end, <strong>you might develop a system
that doesn't actually address (all)
the problems of the user(s) of that
system</strong>.</li>
<li>Another disadvantage is that, while
clarifying the requirements, the
technical solution will need to be
adapted to fulfill the new
features/details that were clarified
or discovered during requirements
elicitation. That means
<strong>modifying/rethinking the technical solution several times during
requirements clarification</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible advantage:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having an overview of the technical solution while discussing the requirements, you might ""bend"" or negotiate the requirements in order to <strong>avoid later discovery of technical issues</strong> (e.g. performance problems, unfeasible or costly features with added value not proportional with the cost of implementing them). But you have to be careful not to invest too much on the technical design before the requirements are really clarified.</li>

","<architecture><project-management><requirements>","2009-07-29 23:41:06","953","0","7","1206633","<p>Yes. Combining requirements and technical design clouds your thinking -- it prevents you from later coming up with new ideas about how to improve the system by doing a different technical approach/optimization.</p>

<p>Especially in new technology areas, you may very well start off with the wrong approach. Combining the technical design and requirements induces you to think of your technnical approach as a requirement, when it could very well be scrapped and done differently.</p>

<p>Also, when it comes time to test (actually that time should be before design) then you may be testing your technical approach rather than what the porgram actually needs to do.</p>

","<architecture><project-management><requirements>","2009-07-29 23:41:06","953","0","7","1209298","<p>Another difference in the two is that requirements development requires extensive contact with the client (external or internal client) and many good technical people simply don't have the people skills to manage client relationships well or to talk to actaul users without insulting them. Only you can say if you do. You will find it is much harder and more complicated than you think if you haven't been doing it. Plus you may find yourself asking the wrong questions because you are failing to see the viewpoint of the user since your expertise is in the viewpoint of the developer and designer.</p>

<p>Personally I also find that having multiple people involved in the design process (gather requirements and translate them into a design) is helpful in terms of idea generating and in terms of thinking of things the other person may have missed. Moving from two people doing this to one may not a good idea from the standpoint of team synergy. When the same person does both, it is easy to do things in only the way you are used to and there is no one else involved to challenge your assumptions until you are much farther along the path where it becomes more difficult to change.</p>

<p>If you have the time, please read on to see exactly what I am talking about.</p>

<p>When I was developing embedded SW for airbag controllers, we had the problem that we had to change some parts of the code every time the customer changed their mind regarding the specific requirements.

<p>At that time, I attended the Embedded Systems Conference and heard a brilliant presentation by Stephen Mellor called ""Coping with changing requirements"".

Some of the conditions were not trivial, so we used a lot of function pointers to be able to call lots of little helper functions which somehow resolved some of the conditions. We had several levels of indirection and everything became hard to understand. To make a long story short, we ended up using a lot of memory, runtime and code complexity. Debugging the thing was not straightforward either. The boss made us change some things back because the modules were getting too heavy (and he was maybe right!).</p>

if( require_deployment)
     trigger_gas_release()

Or it might be true if the customer's requests make it necessary to release a new version of software, and a new software version is a costly procedure to build (lots of paperwork, or perhaps OTP chips burned by the chip maker).</p>

<p>Modularity is very good principle for these sort of things. Sounds as though you're already doing it to some degree. It's good to aim to isolate the often-changing code to as small an area as possible, and try to keep the rest of the code (""helper"" functions) separate (modular) and as stable as possible.</p>

"983584","How to make your embedded C code immune to requirement changes without adding too much overhead and complexity?","<p>In many embedded applications there is a tradeoff between making the code very efficient or isolating the code from the specific system configuration to be immune to changing requirements.</p>

<p><strong>What kinds of C constructs do you usually employ to achieve the best of both worlds (flexibility and reconfigurabilty without losing efficiency)?</strong></p>

<p>If you have the time, please read on to see exactly what I am talking about.</p>

<p>When I was developing embedded SW for airbag controllers, we had the problem that we had to change some parts of the code every time the customer changed their mind regarding the specific requirements. For example, the combination of conditions and events that would trigger the airbag deployment changed every couple weeks during development. We hated to change that piece of code so often.</p>

<p>At that time, I attended the Embedded Systems Conference and heard a brilliant presentation by Stephen Mellor called ""Coping with changing requirements"".

<p>The main idea of this was to implement the core behavior in your code but configure the specific details in the form of data. The data is something you can change easily and it can even be programmable in EEPROM or a different section of flash.</p>

<p>This idea sounded great to solve our problem. I shared this with my colleague and we immediately started reworking some of the SW modules.</p>

<p>When trying to use this idea in our coding, we encountered some difficulty in the actual implementation. Our code constructs got terribly heavy and complex for a constrained embedded system.</p>

<p>To illustrate this I will elaborate on the example I mentioned above. Instead of having a a bunch of if-statements to decide if the combination of inputs was in a state that required an airbag deployment, we changed to a big table of tables. Some of the conditions were not trivial, so we used a lot of function pointers to be able to call lots of little helper functions which somehow resolved some of the conditions. We had several levels of indirection and everything became hard to understand. To make a long story short, we ended up using a lot of memory, runtime and code complexity. Debugging the thing was not straightforward either. The boss made us change some things back because the modules were getting too heavy (and he was maybe right!).</p>

<p>While it seems like a great idea, what you run into are people who can't and won't write.</p>

<p>People who can't write -- well -- can't write.  They can't communicate with an email or a wiki or any medium outside voice.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some people are ""disorganized"".  Actually, writing is too linear and they don't think linearly.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people don't get the ""write to your audience"" and write stuff that's incomprehensible.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes you can't even figure out what they're talking about, much less what they're writing about.  They talk in jargon or code.  They don't know much but insist on being heard. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some people won't write.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some people refuse to make commitments.  Even in a wiki where it can be retracted.  They feel they must pre-discuss everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people are in the habit of doing everything by giving direction to someone else.  They either don't write for themselves, or, they make people stand around in their office and listen to them talk and type.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people are generally toxic on any kind of project.  They spring new requirements at the last minute.  Their first response is ""that will never work"".  They don't brainstorm well.  When they say it work work, and you beg them for an improvement, they don't have one.  They just know it won't work. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>My experience is that only programmers can use a Wiki successfully.  And only senior-level programmers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>N00bz don't have enough experience to sort out requirements from design from rumors and management fluff.</p></li>
<li><p>N00bz don't always have the language skills to write clearly.  They may eventually, but one look at their Javadoc comments indicates that they're struggling with the ""clarity"" part of writing.</p></li>

<p>It's very appealing.  I'm hoping for people to get better at using wiki's because I think it could have a lot of advantages over more traditional approaches where one person interviews everyone and writes things down.

<p>A wiki doesn't take care of itself.  Unless you have someone responsible for managing it and making sure there is some structure and consistency, it quickly becomes a mess.  The real-world analogy would be to hand each of your team a blank sheet of paper and tell them to write up their part of the requirements.  Problems with this are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every contributor has to make up their own document structure, and write about different things in a different order.  So it's impossible to compare one page to another.</li>
<li>There's no ""index page"" to organize all the disparate contributions.  No one wants a page to ""fall through the cracks,"" but in a wiki that's the <em>default</em> destiny of any page as soon as it's written. </li>
<li>There's no feedback loop to make sure the writing actually gets done.</li>
</ul>

<p>The way to make it work is to apply some process to the project, and use the wiki in accordance with that process.</p>

<ul>
<li>Give people the ability to create a new page in the wiki, but only through an interface that automatically links the new page into the right index.</li>
<li>Define a lifecycle for documents, so they are sure to be drafted, reviewed, and approved at the appropriate stages.</li>
<li>Provide a template for a new page.  Provide the section headings that you need in each of these pages, and make part of the review process a confirmation that head section has been filled out adequately.</li>

I would strongly suggest SmartSheet (I'm a strong advocate of the product) - it provides a spreadsheet like interface where you can store multiple files per row/task, send out automated updates to users and maintain specification revisions...
The other approach could be the use of Google email, docs and calendar - a free friendly way of team interaction....I would shy away from issue/bug tracking tools for project management - they tend to have differ on focus: PM tools on the entire project/resource/timeline and Issue tracking tools for specific entered issues....</p>

<ul>
<li>a table defining requirements attributes,</li>
<li>which creates interactive forms with field selection and validation (where you can also document discussions and rationales, embed images, attach documents, link to other requirements...),</li>
<li>and then queries on these ""requirements"" and show them as tables that can be sorted, filtered, printed, reported against, etc. (e.g., <a href=""http://jucmnav.softwareengineering.ca/ucm/bin/view/ProjetSEG/JUCMNavRequirementsVer2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jucmnav.softwareengineering.ca/ucm/bin/view/ProjetSEG/JUCMNavRequirementsVer2</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, one can easily use hyperlinks and Wiki links along the way. FosWiki also has features that can be used to enforce specific workflows, if needed. It is also easy to support forms for use cases and other paradigms (we have done this in the past, and that works generally well).</p>

<p>Wikis such as FosWiki are extensible and one could develop further modules for addressing weaknesses related to traceability management and impact analysis, table-based modifications of requirements, overall packaging, etc. </p>

<p>First, I'm thinking about a document which specifies every feature that needs to be tested, something like this (making this up):</p>

<ol>
<li>user registration form

<ol>
<li>country dropdown (are countries fetched from the server correctly?)</li>
<li>password validation (are all password rules observed, is user notified if password is too weak?)</li>

After the feature list is complete, I'm thinking about making this list a first column in a spreadsheet which also says when was the feature last tested, did it work, and if it didn't work how did it break. This would give me a document testers could fill after each testing cycle, so that programmers have to-do list, with information what doesn't work and when did it break.</p>

<p>Secondly, I'm thinking of test cases for testers, with detailed steps like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Load user registration form.</li>
<li>(Feature 1.1) Check country dropdown menu.

<ol>
<li>Is country dropdown populated with countries?</li>
<li>Are names of countries localized?</li>
<li>Is the sort order correct for each language?</li>

<li>(Feature 1.2) Enter this passwords: ""a"", ""bob"", ""password"", ""password123"", ""password123#"". Only the last password should be accepted.</li>
<li>Press ""OK"".</li>
<li>(Feature 2) Check thank-you note.

<ol>
<li>Is the text localized to every supported language?</li>
</ol></li>

<p>For the steps, don't forget to include an evaluate step, where you, the testers, developers, etc. evaluate the testing results and update the requirement/test doc for the next round (you will often run into things that you could not have thought of and should add into the spec...both from a requirements perspective and testing one).</p>

<p>I also highly recommend using mindmapping/work-breakdown-structure to ensure you have all of the requirements properly captured.</p>

Joel Spolsky has written <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a good essay</a> on this topic, with examples.  Don't expect the spec to remain unchanged during development though: build revisions into the plan.</p>

<p>meade, above, has recommended combining the spec with the tests.  This is known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Test Driven Development</a> and is a very good idea.  It pins things down in a way that natural language often doesn't, and cuts down the amount of work.</p>

<p>You also need to think about unit tests and automation.  This is a big time saver and quality booster.  The GUI level tests may be difficult to automate, but you should make the GUI layer as thin as possible, and have automated tests for the functions underneath.  This is a huge time saver later in development because you can test the whole application thoroughly as often as you like.  Manual tests are expensive and slow, so there is a strong temptation to cut corners: ""we only changed the Foo module, so we only need to repeat tests 7, 8 and 9"".  Then the customer phones up complaining that something in the Bar module is broken, and it turns out that Foo has an obscure side effect on Bar that the developers missed.  Automated tests would catch this because automated tests are cheap to run.  See <a href=""http://www.secondlifeinsider.com/2007/10/23/side-effects-anatomy-of-a-second-life-bug/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for a true story about such a bug.</p>

<p>If your application is big enough to need it then specify modules using TDD, and turn those module tests into automated tests.</p>

<p>An hour to run through all the manual tests sounds a bit optimistic, unless its a very simple application.  Don't forget you have to test all the error cases as well as the main path.</p>

You can test for specific old bugs and also make more generalizations.  Since the same sorts of bugs tend to crop up over and over again this will give you a test suite that's more about catching real bugs and less about the impossible (or very expensive) task of full coverage.</p>

<p>Make use of GUI and web automation.  <a href=""http://seleniumhq.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Selenium</a>, for example.  A lot can be automated, much more than you think.  Your user registration scenario, for example, is easily automated.  Even if they must be checked by a human, for example cross browser testing to make sure things look right, the test can be recorded and replayed later while the QA engineer watches.  Developers can even record the steps to reproduce hard to automate bugs and pass that on to QA rather than taking the time consuming, and often flawed, task of writing down instructions.  Save them as part of the project.  Give them good descriptions as to the intent of the test.  Link them to a ticket.  Should the GUI change so the test doesn't work any more, and it will happen, you can rewrite the test to cover its intention.</p>

<p>I will amplify what Paul Johnson said about making the GUI layer as thin as possible.  Separate form (the GUI or HTML or formatting) from functionality (what it does) and automate testing the functionality.  Have functions which generate the country list, test that thoroughly.  Then a function which uses that to generate HTML or AJAX or whatever, and you only have to test that it looks about right because the function doing the actual work is well tested.  User login.  Password checks.  Emails.  These can all be written to work without a GUI.  This will drastically cut down on the amount of slow, expensive, flawed manual testing which has to be done.</p>

<p>Very few developers have formal methods experience. The only time I've seen clients with formal methods training were members of the ZUG when we were porting <a href=""http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/hise/cadiz/home.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">CADiZ</a> to Windows.  </p>

<p>There's a very large gap between Z, which is a formal method, taking its basis in set theory, and UML, which is a informal notation with some semi-formal notations (state machines) tagged on.</p>

<p>Some technical clients, such as you'd expect to find using a software requirements tool, are quite comfortable with UML.</p>

<p>There may be value creating a Z model of your domain, and there may be value in creating a pi-calculus model of your messaging between client and server (or petri-net, but I find pi is both simpler and more powerful). </p>

<p>What a Z model of your domain would give is an implementation independent set of type constraints, expressed more powerfully than the type system of any common implementation language. </p>

<p>What a formal model of your messaging would give you is the facility to run analyses  to ensure you don't lose updates or get conflicts or deadlocks. </p>

<p>What a UML model gives you is a notation for breaking a large system up into function areas (package diagrams), of showing how classes in those areas relate to each other statically (class diagrams), of showing how instances of those classes relate dynamically (sequence, activity and interaction diagrams), and showing how the packages are deployed (component and deployment diagrams). These are useful for communication in the team, and to get ideas fleshed out a bit, but don't have formally defined semantics which allows very sophisticated analysis.   </p>

<p>The Z specialists I worked with in the '90s considered the idea of specifying a CASE GUI in Z ridiculous. Creating a UML model for such a GUI is commonplace.</p>

<p>I haven't used formal design-by-contract pre and post conditions, though I do sometimes add them in comments, and frequently in assertions, and I unit test conditions which might violate them.</p>

","<user-interface><requirements>","2009-04-02 09:15:01","4111","6","5","709010","<p>Actually it does make sense in this regard.  Use cases differ here in that they cannot be used in the same way.  Use cases will be usefull to extract and formalize requirements.</p>

<p>I was workinng in a UI lab a while back and we toyed with this concept, though we did not call it as such.  Basic idea here is that we would use agile iterative approach to development where we would use usability tesing to help converge on a desired solution.</p>

<p>Typical cycle would be :</p>

<ul>
<li>draft a few requirements and use cases, very limited in scope very focused.</li>
<li>Create a test protocol that would allow us to gather data on this feature (usability, ease of use, acceptance, performace etc).</li>
<li>Create or expand the application to include this feature</li>
<li>have a few users test the application using agile adaptation of usability testing (see <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=561768"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ruben's Handbook of Usability Testing</a>) where we would limit test sessions to 15 minutes with a 15 minutes debreifing.</li>
<li>Extract usefull data from testing to inject in future iteration.</li>
</ul>

<p>This method was perticularely usefull when the users would either not know exactly what they wanted or could not tell us.  We would therefore have to devise tests that would gather objective data on the actuall usefulness of the software to the user and try to ajust the next iteration consequently.  (many of our ""customers"" if I may call them so were heavily handicapped and could not talk so we had to be creative).</p>

<p>This way of working forced us to have a GUI available to the client very early in the software's development life and because it was the central point where we would direct testing one could say it was GUI driven desing since the driving force for convergence was the user interactions with the system.</p>

<p>Although we developped this technique mostly for very specific cases we did some testing with normal users on a normal software and got very positive results.  The desing would converge very quickly towards the usre's needs.  Also the fact that they participated in this desing approach had also very positive effects on the acceptance of the product in the target community.</p>

<p>Unfortunately internal strifes had the lab dismanteled before we could publish our results and expand this line of research, a shame really.</p>

<p>So UIDD (if you pardon the bad acronym) would be a member of the TDD family of approaches towards software development where the iterations hinges around user interactions.</p>

  <p>... how do you test how easily accessible your user-interface is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With usability tests.</p>

<p>Basically, you grab a bunch of your friends (because you won't have any money to encourage strangers to participate) give them the documentation a new user would have and ask them to perform the system's key use cases.</p>

<p>Ideally, you want your test users to have at least some of the qualities of your target users, so if your system is aimed at a technical audience then your classmates will work; however, if your system is aimed at the general public then you're going to want to get your friends in Arts, Human Kinetics, etc. to participate.</p>

<p>So how do you turn that into requirements? You identify your key use cases and stipulate what how usable should they be (walk-up usable, a few minutes with the documentation, real actual training...) and then verify that your test subjects can complete the use cases without too much frustration, with the right amount of training, in a reasonable time.</p>

<p>You already gave yourself the answer, because usability can be described in terms of requirements like ""an entry should be deleted in less then 100ms after the initial call"".</p>

<p>What makes a user interface 86% intuitive? This can’t be answered without some form of measurement. You need to ask what features can make a user interface intuitive. Talk to the customer and the potential future users. Gather features (or better dig for them!), which would make working with the piece of software easier.</p>

<p>Maybe you get a list of features like:</p>

<ul>
<li>The department’s organization must be
shown in a hierarchical tree view.</li>
<li>In this tree view drag &amp; drop must be
possible.</li>
<li>The font size must be
configurable and saved for each user.</li>
<li>On the top of the screen there must
be a list of important links. Each
user may configure and save his own
personal list.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Make requirements out of these features. They are “testable” and thus “measureable”. If in the acceptance tests it turns out that 17 out of 20 features are working, you have 85% success.</p>

<p>EDIT: This works in a project environment, where you need to deliver measurements (like in many commercial projects). If you have a ""softer"" form of project environment where not everybody is poking on figures, then sticking too much on this formalism may be counterproductive since flexibility and agility may suffer from this.</p>

Again, the only way to know is through usability testing.</p>

<p>To start with, you may find it helpful to sit down and imagine exactly who the intended user is. Give them a background, give them a bit of colour, then send them to your imagined application and try and figure out how they as individuals would want to interact with it.</p>

<p>Remember, different users are concerned about different aspects of usability. Don't just concentrate on the story path you think <em>you</em> would follow if you were using the application.</p>

<p>Next it might be helpful to break the site down into usability components. Does it have a lot of pictures? If so, what's the best way of presenting a lot of pictures to a user. Does it have a deeply nested menu structure? Might there be a better way than a sitetree to help your users navigate their way around?
Usability design patters will help you here. A good resource for design patterns for usability can be found <a href=""http://www.welie.com/patterns/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Design patterns are good because they clearly explain to everyone involved how certain functionality is supposed to work.</p>

<p>Take a moment to consider accessibility in combination with usability. How the site work with javascript turned off is always a very good place to start and can be a great help to developers who tend to get very tired of watching their designer stick yet another <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> link on a page that is going to need to submit a form.</p>

<p>Remember, usability is about clarity and it begins with clear communication to the people building the system. If you can't speak clearly about what you want built how do you expect the developers to build something functional? Take the extra time to paper prototype if you have to. </p>

<p>For any printer you look at, be sure to calculate a cost per page including toner and the drum.  If you can find a printer model a few years old for which third party toners exist, look at that carefully.  I know that Brother and Okidata printers are great for business/spec type printing and have the lowest toner costs on the market.  My next printer will be one of them.</p>

<p>Beyond that, try to find a printer that:
- is network capable (wireless is a nice to have)
- duplexer is a nice to have.  I like to use the backs of the sheets to take notes on the printed sheet next to it.
- has multi function capabilities.  I live by my fax to email scanner.  I email it into my case manager and title it appropriately and file away the paper.  if I need it again, I can print off the PDF again.</p>

A printer should have the following feature set:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Duplex printing - so you can bind a
document of more than 50 pages or so
into a booklet.  This is a big win on
larger documents.</p></li>
<li><p>A3 printing - so you can print out
larger diagrams such as database
models.</p></li>
<li><p>PostScript - PCL still has
limitations that bite from time to
time.  Also, anything but Windows
works much better with a Postscript
printer.</p></li>
<li><p>Network connection if you want to connect
more than one computer to it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Colour is optional, a nice-to-have.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that you can get high spec laser printers off ebay for peanuts.  I have a HP 9000DTN, which is a large 50ppm A3 printer with a duplexing unit.  It's the type that has options for collators, staplers, paper feeders with a 2000 sheet capacity and a scanner to use it as a photocopier.  It's a bit too big and clunky, but it cost me £400 off ebay.  You might want go get something smaller (I didn't realise how big it was until it arrived), although something like this with the photocopier bits might be a win.  I've also seen HP 4xxx printers with duplex units and low usage (12,000 sheets) go for about £100.</p>

"479739","How do you manage customers with regards to changing requirements?","<p><a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/08/business-requirements-are-bullshit.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steve Yegge's wisdom</a> notwithstanding, most developers are faced with requirements which were gathered from non-technical customers.  Sometimes there are project managers who deal with the customers and translate their requirements, other times not.  In any event, the fact that the requirements will change is an inevitability.</p>

<p>Most of what consititues ""good programming practice"" has to do with <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/466081/adapting-to-meet-changing-business-requirements"">developing systems which are adaptable</a> so that they can withstand changing requirements.  Principles like YAGNI, DRY, loose coupling, etc. contribute to this.  Iterative development processes such as Agile also attempt to address the concern of trying to hit a moving target, and of course having a system under test makes it infinitely more feasible to make changes.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it seems that for many of us changing requirements can not only <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/162367/what-hurts-the-quality-of-your-code-most"">hurt the quality of our software</a>, but can also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71199/what-makes-you-lose-motivation"">drain our motivation</a> and make us want to stab someone.</p>

<p>This question is about how to <strong>manage the customer</strong> to make it possible for them to change their requirements in the ways that they need, while discouraging arbitrary or frivolous changes.  How do you do it?</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you have project managers to insulate the devs from the customer?</li>
<li>Do you have a formal change management process?  Change managers?</li>
<li>How difficult is it for the customer to get a change when they really need it?</li>
<li>Conversely, how easy is it for a customer to get a change when it's ""frivolous""?</li>
<li>How much detail do you give the customer when explaining the cost of a change?</li>
<li>How quickly are you able to give the customer this information after receiving a request for change?</li>
<li>What factors can torpedo the process (e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/463512/telling-a-project-manager-no"">PM's who can't say no to the customer?</a>)</li>
<li><strong>What works for you?</strong></li>
</ul>
","<project-management><requirements><change-management>","2009-01-26 13:10:40","5646","8","7","479761","<p>I work as indpenedent developer and so contact with customers directly. It's normal that most of the time they have no idea what they actually want. So we start slowly and I give them prototype early on to play with and then the changes will be gradualy made. If I think that customers wants ""frivolous"" change then I tell him that this change doesn't work or is not needed. If it is 5 min of work then I might even do it anyway.</p>

<p>It helps to add later on to the contract some maintenance clause to get money for those small changes that will come up later on. For bigger changes you just charge by the hour.</p>
