"3227766","What tools can I use to determine the hardware requirements of my application?","<p><sub>For regular readers: The saga™ continues...</sub></p>

<p>My app runs fine on my development machine - which was purchased (5 years ago) as a fairly good gaming rig. As such, it's 64bit, has a 2.2GHz clock-speed and has 2GB of memory.</p>

<p>The machines at work however, are standard Dell issue office computers and really struggle to even start my app, let alone run it.</p>

<p>(<em>Explanation... I can imagine people screaming at me: ""What on earth are you doing to require a spec like that?"" Well, I'm doing a lot of real time image analysis and audio generation. So there.</em>)</p>

<p>Our team has the budget to buy a dedicated laptop (needs to be portable) to run it on. So now I've been tasked with generating a minimum required spec.</p>

<p>What tools can I use to determine the lowest spec capable of comfortably running my app?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The answers so far, whilst useful, focus more on alternatives to profiling. So I've put up a bounty to see if there is any software that'll do this sort of thing.</p>

<p><strong>Use YOUR software to check the hardware requirements for YOUR software.</strong></p>

<p>I don't quite understand why the spec of your development machine isn't simply the required spec for the laptop you propose to buy.  But if that's not good enough for some reason, run your software on some hardware with other specifications.  You could, for example take 1GB RAM out of your development machine to see how things go with less memory available.</p>

<p>There is a huge amount of benchmarking software available for all sorts of tasks.  For example LINPACK is much used for benchmarking supercomputers.  The flaw in all of these off-the-shelf benchmarks, and in the approach in general, is that they only give you good information about how a computer runs the benchmark. Transforming benchmark results into predictions of performance of hardware with your software is more an art than a science.  In the supercomputer world organisations benchmark their own key applications on new platforms before purchasing.</p>

<p>That requirement won't just say ""some tables are 600px wide"" and if it does you need a better way to elicit requirements.</p>

"3025365","Traceability with XSD","<p>I am trying to let my XML schema handle a little traceability functionality as I'm gathering requirements while I read through some functional specifications. (Not ideal for requirement management, but at least its a start.)</p>

<p>What I'm doing is creating a &lt;<em>functionalSpec></em> tag for each functional specification I am currently reading through. I create a &lt;<em>requirement></em> tag for each requirement I find. Since I want to be able to trace where the requirement came from, I create a &lt;<em>trace></em> element with the <em>id</em> of the &lt;<em>functionalSpec></em> element. Instead of allowing myself to enter any plain-old-text in the &lt;<em>functionalSpecId></em> tag, I want the XSD to validate and make sure that I only enter in an <em>id</em> that exists for an existing functional spec. My problem is coming in where it seems the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/"" rel=""noreferrer"">XML Schema W3C Recommendations</a> documentation says that what I want to do is not possible. (about 1/2 way down)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>{selector} specifies a restricted XPath ([XPath]) expression <strong>relative to instances of the element being declared</strong>. This must identify a node set of subordinate elements (i.e. contained within the declared element) to which the constraint applies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm using Oxygen to create this since I'm fairly new to XSD files, and it gives me the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E [Xerces] Identity Constraint error:  identity constraint ""KeyRef@1045a2"" has a keyref which refers to a key or unique that is out of scope.</p>

"3023501","How to define supported BlackBerry OS versions and models for application?","<p>After company wins a project it is usual to mention in contract what devices are supported and what OS versions are supported. </p>

<p>But taking into account BlackBerry it appears sometimes to be tricky, as you can have the same device model, but two and(or) more different OS versions (or within same OS different package versions). And in this situation application may need to be updated. </p>

<p>So the main question here is what is expected to be mentioned in contract? Could you please share some your experience of resolving such problems? </p>

<p>So as a good example can be case of video playback issue on Storm: 
some issue exists on 5.0.0.XXX (network provider A) and doesn't exist on 5.0.0.YYY (network provider B), 
or could be following: 
5.0.0.XXX1 (network provider A) - issue exist 
5.0.0.XXX2 (network provider A) - issue doesn't exist </p>

<p>The point here is to define some boundaries of development company responsibility.</p>
","<blackberry><requirements>","2010-06-11 14:15:49","240","1","1","3025084","<p>I would suggest keeping it simple and specify both the models you agree to support (by model number - Storm 9530, Storm 9550, Bold 9000, etc.) and then for each model which major OS versions you intend to support.  For Storm it could be 4.7 and 5.0.  I wouldn't go down into the actual build level - even though there may be bugs or differences between minor builds, it's best to just account for that in your app and have the contract agree on the major OS versions.  Otherwise you'll get bogged down in the details and find that your contract needs to be continually updated as RIM and the carriers release new minor OS updates.</p>

<p>That said, I personally have never been in a situation when I have really urgently needed this. Still, I'd say any self-respecting VCS should have a search function, or an external tool available that does the job.

<p>The color of the background is not a specific function or behavior of the system and it also can not be used to judge the operation of a system.</p>
<p>I think that these kind of UI requirements do not need to be specified at the beginning of a software design cycle. What if during development you find out that the wrong type of blue was described? These choices are not requirements, but need to be sorted out during UI development (preferably with a user group to judge).</p>

","<history><requirements><use-case>","2010-05-31 07:34:28","498","1","2","3791191","<p>I think it is important to distinguish between the activity and notation. As said above, previously, there was no structure and threfore every requirement was a set of lines. Use cases define goals, specific actors, can include another use case or be extended by another use case and they can be even parametrized. This allows to eliminate much of the duplication in those long requirements documents in an understandable manner. But this is about notation only, use cases as such do not come with any other activity to elicitate requirements than the older technique. User stories on the other hand, without explicit written scenarios, are even shorter in notation. The interesting thing happens, when you write the scenarios for user stories, as with the Cucumber, than you have actually more to write and more brittle description as with use cases, but the important fact is, that user stories offer different activity. Rather than trying to cover the scenarios upfront, you write them on demand, incrementally and iteratively, which means you can better cope with change of requirements. However it is quite hard to remove the duplication from user stories and the Given-When-Then template for scenarios replace functional nature of use cases by finite stae machines.</p>

The difference really has more to do with the web browser than the web site.  As far as dynamic behavior, I'd suggest going with a javascript framework that already addresses differences between major browsers.  CSS is more problematic, but you should still be able to approximate the same look and feel, though it may take some work.  Without knowing what specific problems you're having it's hard to know how to suggest that you solve them.  Generally, I would target and test IE 8/7, FireFox, and Safari (or Chrome).  You might want to throw in Opera as well, though my experience has been that if you get FF, you generally have already gotten it to work for Opera.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble with getting the generated HTML to work the way you want it to, you might want to try using ASP.NET MVC.  It gives you much more control over your HTML.  This can be really valuable in making things work the way you want it, though, WebForms code can obviously be made to work as well.  Sometimes, though, you have to jump through a few hoops to get it to behave exactly the way you want because the output of web controls isn't always what you and I would produce in every situation.</p>

First of all, read something good about Use Cases, there are different use case levels and that might be a solution to your use cases which do not seem so right. Also do not forget about use case generalization and parametrized use cases if CRUD repetition is the problem. One thing, which is often more important in web applications than in desktop apps is the aspect of usability. This is because of the nature of the web - people have ofthe the coice of not using your service and go to next google result if you app is not usable. So what I think is a good addition to the spec are Personas - just find some possible instances of the human actors for your use cases and try to think of some goals they might want to achieve often using your web app and present how they will achieve them using your web app (and try to make it super easy of course). Another important thing is the Information Architecture - the way in which you will provide information in your web app. This comprises of navigation, some basic layout, but not necessarily design, just information about where to find something in your web app. This can be done using some rapid prototyping tools.</p>

"2545581","Metadata requirements for developers","<p>I'm tasked with providing a list of metadata requirements our data warehouse developers might need.</p>

<p>This is not the business metadata (nice descriptions etc), but rather data required for change management (also known as impact assesment), data lineage etc.</p>

<p>I've seen this article <a href=""http://www.kimballgroup.com/html/articles_search/articles1998/9803d05.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Meta Meta Data Data - Ralph Kimball</a> but as I'm not the first person to do this I'm throwing it to the SO community.</p>

<p>The actual question is this:
What metadata do datawarehouse developers require to design, develop and manage change in ETL routines?</p>

<p>PS: I'm trying to keep the answer platform agnostic but for context this is an Oracle database with PL/SQL and Datastage.</p>
","<database><metadata><data-warehouse><requirements>","2010-03-30 13:35:07","501","3","2","2588936","<p>At the most rudimentary level you could maintain a listing of tablename.fieldname's that are extracted from the source system.  If you are extracting from files or other non-database sources then you may or may not be able to list the dependencies as granular as the field level.  Such meta data would tell you only that If(source field/fileFormat/table changes) then (some change <strong>may</strong> be needed in the ETL process).  I say <em>may</em> because some changes may be minor enough that the ETL process is not broken, but one should still perform testing and data profiling to ensure it doesn't invalidate any assumptions that were in place during the initial design of the ETL process.</p>

<p>While the ETL developer may be intimately familiar with the source system and ETL process, for large ETL projects it would probably be wise to tie each dependency in the source system to specific processes/components of the ETL system.  For example, if your ETL process is composed of many stored procedures, then you would want the metadata to relate each source system field/fileFormat/table/etc. to each stored procedure.  This would be a many-to-many relationship since many stored procedures might depend on a particular field, and a single stored procedure may depend on many source fields.  This would be something manually updated by the ETL developers, as they create or update the ETL system, it would be their responsibility to recognize what fields they are loading/cleaning/conforming and subsequently input that information into the metadata that tracks these dependencies.</p>

<p>If your ETL system is powered by something besides stored procedures, or some combination there of, then you will need to come up with some naming scheme to reference these components.  But the concept is the same, you relate source fields/file formats/etc. to the components of the ETL system.</p>

<p>This will give you enough information to say that where ""Person.FirstName"" changes in the source system in some way, then you can compile a report that shows all the stored procedures which will need to be verified, potentially updated, and tested to cope with the change in the source system.</p>

<p>This kind of implies that knowing that Person.FirstName changed in some way, either size, datatype, and/or removed entirely, requires a manual step of being notified of the change via some database designer, and taking action in response.  If you want a really sophisticated system then you'd need to have triggers/audit on DDL that changes your source system so that you can automatically log and notify your ETL architects of the change.</p>

<p>Should such a change occur, you'd know that sp_Person_Load, sp_Person_Clean, sp_Person_Transform stored procedures all have some dealings with the Person.FirstName field, because the author of those stored procedures noted that in the metadata documenting dependencies.</p>

<p>You could make it more complicated, where sp_Person_Clean doesn't depend on Person.Firstname, but actually depends on sp_Person_Load.  Such that you build a chain of dependencies.  This would make reporting on changes more complicated because you would have to chain dependencies together to determine the impact of a source system change.  And you are also building a complex string of dependencies, and potential circular references, that might make maintaining the metadata as difficult as maintaining the ETL process itself.  If the ETL system is simple enough that the ETL architect can define dependencies in terms of the fields/files/tables from the source system, then do that to keep things simple.</p>

<p>Depending on who has authority over your data warehouse, the destination system, you may need to track these dependencies.  Often the ETL developer is also the data warehouse developer.  However, if someone else is the data warehouse designer, and they have the authority to make changes to the data warehouse, then your ETL developers will need to have a similar system, whether it be automated or manual, to track and be notified of changes and the impact they will have on the ETL process.</p>

<p>Really when I think about how changes should be tracked, I think about the boundaries of authority.  If a ETL developer changes his sp_Person_Clean procedure, he doesn't need emtadata to tell him that sp_Person_Transform will need to be updated/tested.  He already knows this very intuitively.  On the other hand, if a third party/vendor system changes, or if a business department within the same organization changes a spreadsheet or file format, then those are things not enacted by the ETL developer.  He won't have the same level of intimacy with the source systems as he does with his own ETL system and data warehouse.  Thus he will benefit the most from metadata that shows how components of the source system relates to components of the ETL system.</p>

<p>Deciding how granular you want to define ""components"" will really depend on how the systems are designed, and how much meta data you want the developer to document.  Too granular and you drown in the metadata.  Too course and it is like saying ""My house is in Florida"", which doesn't really help the ETL developer in his work.  If the entire ETL process is coded in a single SQL script, then you only have one component.  So the system needs to be designed in advance knowing that you need to be able to refer to specific components and/or steps of the ETL process.</p>

<p>The metadata will only be any good if the developer is diligent in updating it.  There are systems/toolkits that can automatically update this kind of metadata, but they would have to box you into their toolkit so that the tool can analyze the dependencies.  I have little confidence that these systems are very reliable.  There are often times you have to do really hackish things to get data from a source system into the destination in the desired format, and I can imagine a dependency analyzer couldn't understand the dependencies.  For example, if you were using dynamic SQL formed from strings, then the toolkit can't really figure out what the dependencies are.  </p>

<p>However, I will say I have never dove into great depth into the tools to really know how good they are.  I always have gotten to the point that I found things that would normally be easy in SQL to be very cumbersome in the tool, and decided it was more trouble than it was worth.  I keep telling myself I will pick something up like Talend and really become an expert at it before I make my final verdict, but there are always other priorities pulling me in other directions.</p>

"2545581","Metadata requirements for developers","<p>I'm tasked with providing a list of metadata requirements our data warehouse developers might need.</p>

<p>This is not the business metadata (nice descriptions etc), but rather data required for change management (also known as impact assesment), data lineage etc.</p>

<p>I've seen this article <a href=""http://www.kimballgroup.com/html/articles_search/articles1998/9803d05.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Meta Meta Data Data - Ralph Kimball</a> but as I'm not the first person to do this I'm throwing it to the SO community.</p>

<p>The actual question is this:
What metadata do datawarehouse developers require to design, develop and manage change in ETL routines?</p>

<p>PS: I'm trying to keep the answer platform agnostic but for context this is an Oracle database with PL/SQL and Datastage.</p>
","<database><metadata><data-warehouse><requirements>","2010-03-30 13:35:07","501","3","2","2618106","<p>At my workplace, we have home-brew ETL. I can see you raise a brow :). The minimal meta-data we have describes the following. Subscription details, Audit, Data-mapping, Run-order. </p>

<p>The <strong>subscription details</strong> again fall into two categories, vendor from whom the data was purchased and teams/applications using it. The ftp/http details, access credentials are also stored. Fortunately we were asked to have absolutely zero SPs, Major exception ""identity generators"". </p>

<p><strong>Audit details</strong> involve, date of data, last modified time, user who ran it, failure/success count.</p>

<p><strong>Data-mapping table</strong> describes the tables and column names which hold the data. We used to have an additional composite-key descriptor table. However we decided to do away with that. The performance loss was compensated by asking data table owners to create proper partitioning strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Run_order table</strong>  is another table we have which determines if the user can run (Y/N) and the order in which runs can occur.</p>

<p>The meta-data is also stored with an history (based on date). So if any one decides run an archived/historic subscription. The run would go ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Uses of the above</strong>: We can prioritize the data loads based on importance of subscription. We can monitor failures at a generic level (birds-eye view). We can write generic code that can create dynamic sql queries (no hard-coding). Our load and extract processes are forced to use the data-mapping table, so no user can get away with stale information.</p>

<p>This seemed to work so far in our experience.</p>

It really helps if you have a hobby where you collect something so you have something you are interested in:  My CDs, my comics, my books, etc. Typically then you have to figure out how to store data to represent real world objects and relate multiple concepts, such as book, category, and author.  You can add pictures to play with everything from image resizing to storing items in Amazon S3 buckets.  If the objects are things you do something with (such as read or listen to) you can also create a interaction logging system.  Making data models to allow users to catalog not only their collections but their habits of interacting with them (graphs!) should provide plenty of things to code.</p>

</ul>
","<project-management><specifications><analysis><requirements>","2010-03-17 14:11:49","2679","1","2","2493075","<p>In brief, this is exactly why a PM cannot be replaced by a piece of software or methodology. Finding trade-offs between different constraints and matching them to opportunities or team abilities constitutes design and projects are designed in a way similar to software that comes on the other end. The scope and quality requirements will differ depending on the PM personality, knowledge, experience, influence, ability to negotiate and convey his or her vision especially in the software development world where few regulations or hard and fast rules exist. Moreover, project scoping is as much political as rational exercise. </p>

<p>That’s why project plan is an intellectual artefact reflecting individual perspective and project conceptual integrity always hangs on the shoulders of a few key individuals.</p>

<p>Usual inputs and tools used in the scoping process apart from specific requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cost and benefits analysis</a> and various financial measures indicating how profitable or prudent specific requirements are.</li>
<li>Organisational strategy what exists exactly for the purpose of showing direction and giving focus to the efforts.</li>
<li>Various regulations. Their role in software is a somewhat less prominent than in lets say construction. However, financial, entertainment, safety critical software are all subject to regulations. </li>
<li>Industry guidelines</li>
<li>Company Principles (Don’t be evil, Treating Customers Fairly etc)</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Human factors</a> </li>
<li>Environmental factors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even department with the same name within different companies would usually have different amount of power to influence project requirements. This depends on organisational structure and PM needs to be aware of and understand such power configuration really well. For instance, some companies would have a very influential marketing and sales, in others finance would be mostly in charge of the direction. Political requirements can be dissected using <a href=""http://www.csrquest.net/default.aspx?articleID=13626&amp;heading=The%204CR%20Framework"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a three-dimensional scale of</a></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Legitimacy</strong> — indicating whether the claim is valid and claimant actually has a lawful interest in asking for something to get done.</li>
<li><strong>Power</strong> — whether claimant has the authority and muscle to have the things done their way.</li>
<li><strong>Urgency</strong> — indicating if the claimant actually has the need or attributes importance to their claim.</li>
</ol>

<p>If would be very difficult to ignore requirements that have all three: legitimacy, power and urgency. However when looking at the repercussions of this division, most interesting are scenarios where one or two of the elements are missing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Combination of urgency and power without the legitimacy results in some really bad heavily political requirements. </li>
<li>Urgency and legitimacy that lacks power will be looking at making a union or bringing a powerful player on their side to make sure the requirements are heard and acted upon. It might be better to make a deal before hand, since it’s likely to be on much more favourable terms.</li>
<li>Power and legitimacy are unlikely to pursue specific requirements until there is urgency. A PM has to be clever about deciding whether these requirements can be safely ignored or assigned a lower priority.</li>

<p>Start by getting everyone who should have a say together.  This is likely to be one or two representatives from each of sales, development, support, marketing and so on.</p>

<p>Each of these representatives or teams is given a ""budget"" according to their say.  The way the budget is divided up is unlikely to be even - Sales should probably have a far larger say as they represent the users, or the prospect of more money - but that's up to you.  The only thing I'd suggest is that no-one team should have 50% or more of the budget.</p>

<p>Get all the possible changes in the next release on the table and describe them, their benefits and how long they'll take to develop so that everyone understands them.  They should be broken down into similar size chunks as far as possible and no one chunk should take up 50% or more of the time available in the next release.</p>

<p>Now people get to spend their budget.  Each team / individual divides their money up between the things they want to do.  You can spend all of it on one thing or divide it between many.</p>

<p>Once that's done you work out what fits into the release, starting with the thing with the total most money against it, going down until you run out of time in the release.</p>

<p>You might then want to allow them to adjust their ""bids"" and repeat but generally you want no more than three rounds.</p>

<p>Why does this work?</p>

<p>Most importantly for me it taps into the knowledge people have about what's important and allows them to make choices based on that.  </p>

<p>If the developers and / or support know that, say, refactoring the database is key to them, they can spend their whole budget on that (note: this is why no-one should have 50% or more of the budget and no single change should be more than 50% of the release - if you breach those then individual team's ability to say ""this is really critical"" falls away because they don't have the clout to make them happen even if they sacrifice everything else).  </p>

<p>What you're not doing is forcing them to quantify the benefit in ways that don't really make sense to them, they just get to say ""we know this is important and we back this up by saying to us it's more important than anything else and we'll sacrifice everything else (or a bunch of other things) to do it"".</p>

<p>Similarly if sales absolutely <em>must</em> have that holographic interface they can do so but they will have to make sacrifices (in the form of having less money to bid for other things they believe will drive sales) to get it.</p>

<li>If you can afford to write the specs in Confluence, then I think using cross-links between Jira and Confluence is the best way. There are several plugins that implement such links (eg Application Links). 

<ul>
<li>Since the Confluence page must be unique within the space, the hierarchical naming that you show above would be appropriate.</li>
<li>Confluence is a good tool for collaborative development of documents, but it takes a lot of discipline, organization and effort to keep things organized.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternatively, you can use the Labels jira plugin to tag issues with strings such as ""myapp-approvalLogic-mainScreen"". This lets you quickly find all related issues, but not to navigate to the spec</li>
<li>Neither of the approaches above provides a hierarchy though. 

<ul>
<li>Jira+Agile (aka Greenhopper) provides a hierarchy of Versions which is very useful for agile planning. But typically one version (release) works on features from many requirements, so you probably cannot use this hierarchy</li>
<li>Jira components are not hierarchical, and issues are at only 2 levels (a problem that's been discussed for 4 years...)</li>

OM is description of how one organization is <em>khm</em> organized - e.g. how is the hierarchy of employees structured - or what are the requirements of some job position to do it's job (data wise) ... You apply different models business logic on the basis of Organizational Model . Business Logic is probably more familiar term (hint: MVC). </p>

That said, regular changes to your requirements are most often the result of either poor requirements or poor develoment process, or both.</p>

<p><strong>Some Design Up Front?</strong></p>

<p>Business analysis is regularly given the short shrift by developers, project managers, etc. Most devs just want to start hacking away on day 1, and most PMs love to let them: ""Wow, we can move from the project initiation phase to the construction phase in 1 day without any of that ridiculous business analysis stuff taking up time! That'll look great for completion bonuses!"" But remember that the PM's primary job is to keep the project under control (on time and on budget) ...not necessarily to make users happy and certainly not to make developers happy. That's not to say they are totally heartless; good PMs will achieve their goals by enforcing scope control and fostering communication, both of which are helpful.</p>

<p>But taking the time to really think about what's needed and stepping through possible scenarios can make a serious difference in the issues you're dealing with. </p>

<ul>
<li>If you have made an effort to do thorough business analysis and you're still ending up with last minute changes, then perhaps your problem is another classic challenge: disengaged users. Your subject matter experts are your top weapon in dealing with and identifying those corner cases. If you have users that are not engaged in the analysis process, get better subject matter experts.</li>
<li>It's also possible users are disengaged because they are too busy doing their regular work. In that case it's a management issue and they need to be given instructions that project participation is part of their jobs; that's hard sometimes because often the same management that told you to ""get it done yesterday"" is the same group of knuckleheads that is expecting the project to happen magically with no hiccups and without any resources (they are common in that they don't understand the complexities of custom software development and assume it is easy). If management is clueless and won't change...well, you have to either work overtime and deal with the issues you've described, or get a new job. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Can Agile Help?</strong></p>

<p>It'd sure be nice if your users would tell you about those corner cases earlier rather than later, right? This is related to what Toby Hede discussed in his post. Perhaps a methodology that gets the software in front of the users as soon as possible, even in an unpolished state, can trigger feedback sooner. That was one of the inspirations for all the agile concepts. The creators were tired of dealing with the issues you describe and they also realized that if management and users weren't going to change, then maybe the development could. It's still development, but there's an emphasis on getting early feedback through a variety of techniques (have subject matter experts co-located with the dev team, getting rough prototypes into user hands sooner, pair programming to captalize on developer experience, and lots more). All this is because it's understood we're human and we're going to miss things.</p>

<p>Finally, you mention you're trying to make the system extensible to help with the rapid changes, but how? Are you separating presentation logic from business logic? Are you encapsulating business logic in objects, partitioned appropriately to minimize dependencies and coupling? All of those things are tough to do and can take time to plan and build.</p>

<p>You're not alone, by the way. Lots (maybe all) shops have these challenges.</p>

<p>Please do not call that an Agile method or scrum.</p>

<p>That's just craziness.</p>

<p>If you're tweaking things after the sprint starts, you're not doing it right.</p>

<p>You're enabling (indeed, your encouraging) bad behavior.  If they can't get the requirements <strong>before</strong> the sprint starts, you have two choices.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wait.  Nothing wrong with this.  It's cheaper in the long run.</p></li>
<li><p>Start.  However.  Since the requirements are fixed for the duration of the sprint, you have to finish the sprint with no ""tweaking"".  Changes become part of the backlog.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can do shorter sprints.</p></li>
<li><p>You can simply backlog the tweaks until they get the idea that they're causing their own problems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, a lot of management review is not very Agile.  It's not <em>per se</em> wrong.  But it indicates a lack of trust.  Agile means collaboration and interaction between developers and product owners.  It doesn't mean another layer of management review.</p>

","<process><agile><scrum><requirements>","2009-11-26 11:27:27","7687","10","6","1808453","<p>I agree with the others; your Product Owner is non-existent. You really can't start a sprint until you have enough solid requirements to make a commitment, and your Product Owner agrees with that commitment. Once the commitment is made, neither party can change it within the context of Scrum unless you abandon the sprint and re-plan. Of course, you're not doing this.</p>

<p>I would further state that your Scrum Master is not following his or her responsibilities as Keeper of the Process. Why is he letting you start up a sprint when you don't have a valid product backlog to choose your sprint backlog items from? Do you even have a Scrum Master?</p>

<p>I understand that your team is just trying to get work done, but what is really happening is that you're enabling bad behavior on the part of the product managers, who don't need to have a backlog with well-defined user stories ready before the start of the sprint. </p>

<p>There's a reason that Scrum has a Scrum Master and a Product Owner, and requires agreement between the Product Owner and team on the sprint backlog before the sprint starts. Not having these assigned roles and not following the Scrum process causes things to break. Yes, it's easier to avoid the parts of Scrum that point out bad behavior, but you won't change bad behavior until it is acknowledged. Remember, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results. You're going to have to change what you do if you want to change the results.</p>

<p>Not really. User stories capture the essence but this doesn't mean no details. Details are transmitted during conversation and are definitely <strong>mandatory</strong> for a good understanding of what has to be done (not even mentioning that it seems hard to estimate anything if you don't know what to do and what is expected). </p>

<p>Communicating details about stories is actually a part of the job of the Product Owner (PO). This should occur during the first part of the Sprint planning meeting where the PO explains each stories to the team, before the planning poker and/or at anytime if any clarification is required. In other words, feel free to ask the PO for details (and ask the PO for the acceptance criteria too). And if there is too much uncertainty, put a big estimate in front of the story and explain why you can't make a ""better"" estimate. </p>

<p>To me, your PO/customer/stakeholders don't seem to participate very actively and this is a big, very BIG impediment. Your ScrumMaster needs to take care of this, there is no magical solution.</p>

<p>If you think about it, there are many ways you can mis-state requirements, either intentionally or otherwise.  Some ways to deal with the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Realize that the requirements of a system can change continuously.  Otherwise the client will say ""yeah, that changed, nobody told you?""</p></li>
<li><p>Ask the requirements of several key people - It;s not enough to ask the CEO, and likewise, it's not enough to ask the lower ranks that will actually be using your system.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure there are a handful of people accountable for communicating the requirements to you - These people (no more than 5 in a mid-size project) should have a BIG incentive to give you all the information for a successful implementation.  If you do not have these people, you  are likely to fail as everyone will be too busy to explain things to you, and they will have an incentive not to talk to you, since you will be able to claim X person told you to implement the system they way you did.  You need management's support in creating this group of people.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to verify assumptions with other people.  Sometimes you need to ask the same question five different ways.</p></li>
<li><p>Be afraid of absolutes... ""The sale price cannot be changed"" sometimes means ""I'd like an supervisor override to be implemented in case a price needs to be changed for the current customer.""</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the business process as much as possible.  If you are writing a banking application ask to spend a day at the bank to see how people would use the system.  If you deliver a phase of the project do the same thing: Watch the system being used, and be proactive in looking for holes.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize when something is not specified in enough detail and insist on getting it right.  Do mockups, hand drawings, flowcharts, whatever it takes to make sure the source of the requirements and you are on the same page.</p></li>

<p>These are all just from experience...  I think ""bad requirements"" really means ""bad communications between client and implementor.""</p>

","<requirements>","2009-11-06 23:41:44","5394","10","11","1691347","<p>My experience show next possible sources of <strong>bad</strong> requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users / clients often don't know what they want.
The possible way to handle this either means have good business analysts who could
perform required analyze or have good ready product which could suit this user (or not).</li>
<li>Analysts can't provide appropriate quality of requirements.
Yes, it happens. Hire better analysts / technology experts but <em>before</em> failure, not 
<em>after</em>. Test requirements, analyze usage cases, draw state an sequence diagrams
as early as possible to understand user cases coverage and
so on. In other word this is related to general modelling.</li>
<li>Well, there is possibility of bad translation from marketing requirements / model into
technical specifications.</li>
<li>Design quality problem (implementation can't meet requirements).</li>
</ul>

<p>What should be done to overcome these problems? Let's allow engineers to provide feedbacks, let's not close requirements and make them flexible as possible. Often even with generally good consistent requirements we face some low level hardware limitation on implementation stage and need to track changes back. From other side let's understand customers, not only technologies. I saw number of projects with large parts of work thrown away just because they look good for developers but not for customers. The better communications with customer you have the lower is possibility of such cases.</p>

<p>My understanding is process should allow flexible requirements change during all the stages  but from other side should make all of this work trackable and limit scope to minimum that required. The problem is to balance between all of this. At least my suggestion is we should move to shortest development cycles to lower all the risks.</p>

<p>I see a lot of good answers here about the a bad requirement being one that is miscommunicated or half-baked. And they're probably correct. </p>

<p>But for me one of the worst types of ""bad requirement"" is the one that's simply missing. I see this time and again in systems. A day after going live, the users say, ""Oh, what about XYZ? We really need that."" To which the project team responds, ""XY what? We've been working on this project for a year and NOW you tell us?""</p>

<p><strong>Why is it bad?</strong></p>

<p>This is a killer because now everyone has to scramble and rush out a solution, not that the average developer needs any help promoting half-assed things to production, but you just know it's going to spell lots of production support for all the poor people this 'solution' is handed over to for maintenance...you know, the ones that didn't get project bonuses. </p>

<p>Again, this is not a bad requirement but one that was <em>never a requirement to begin with</em>. That doesn't mean it's invalid; it most certainly could be critical. But between the rush to get things done and an aggressive project pace, and the fact that we're all humans and we make mistakes, this was overlooked.</p>

<p><strong>How do you avoid it?</strong> </p>

<p>You could spend more time up front and hope a sharp subject matter expert picks up the missing gap. A more effective and more costly method is taking the time to engage what some call a ""model office"" phase. This is like a system test, but designed to simulate real life conditions. The testers aren't just verifying that the system delivers correct output for 1 + 1, but that all its parts work within the context of the business process. </p>

<p>This is a hard sell of course. Many projects will give business analysis and testing the short shrift in order to uphold the almighty metrics of ""on time and on budget"". But if you want to shake these missing requirements out, you have to let the user run with it. It's then that they'll recognize things they took for granted in a verbal requirements definition session. Agilists would add that this test needs to be done as early and as often as possible to uncover these risks and give the project team time to identify their priorities and make adjustments where warranted.</p>

<p>In your documentation for this interface indicate that a class should only implement this (empty) interface if the class designer has considered the requirements you stated.</p>

<p>Then you can set the Value type of your map to MappableCommand, and only MappableCommands will be able to be added to the map.</p>

<p>This is similar to the logic behind why one needs to implement the (blank) interface Serializable for classes that can be serialized by Java's default serialization mechanisms.</p>

<p>If this doesn't work, then you may have to settle for throwing a run time error;</p>

<p>Fake Edit:</p>

<p>If I was asking a DB programmer, I may simply ask, ""what's the cardinality between a Lead and a Reference?"" However, this doesn't always make sense to a business user.</p>

"1203679","Requirements and technical design as a single effort?","<p>I've been working on a large, multi-year project as a web architect.</p>

<p>So far, my responsibility has been to take requirements documentation provided by the customer's analyst and translate them into technical design documentation.</p>

<p>The 'powers that be' suggest that I take over the requirements documentation and combine them with my efforts on technical design.</p>

<p>Is there a specific problem you see with combining requirements and technical design into one step?</p>

I don't argue that requirements need be set in stone before development begins (heaven forbid), but I'd hope it'd be pretty certain what kind of thing you're building by this point. So if the point by now is just ""requirements documentation"" (rather than really digging into what the customer is looking for), I can't see any deep problem here.</p>

<p>While there is a certain advantage to separating development from a ""customer advocacy"" role, a professional developer shouldn't have trouble keeping track of requirements without generating any conflicts of interest. Is there some other issue you were concerned about? Is requirements documentation even a large task at this point? Reducing the number of layers between the customer and the developer actually sounds like a pretty good thing.</p>

<p>If you're getting requirements, you'll actually be talking to the business.  It'll give you a chance to learn the business and hear what they really need, unvarnished and unfiltered.  You'll have a chance to persuade them to talk about the problem in business terms instead of assuming a technical solution and jumping right to design (e.g., ""Add this column to this table and tie it to this text box on this page."")   Maybe you'll be able to see ways of attacking a problem that they didn't even know existed.</p>
