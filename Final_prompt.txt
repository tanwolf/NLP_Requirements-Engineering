User
I queried Stackoverflow for questions and answers concerning Azure Data Factory. I used the stackexchange database.


This is the query:


SELECT

    q.Id AS QuestionId,
    
    q.Title AS QuestionTitle,
    
    q.Body AS QuestionBody,
    
    q.Tags AS QuestionTags,
    
    q.CreationDate AS Date,
    
    q.ViewCount AS ViewCount,
    
    q.Score AS Score,
    
    q.AnswerCount AS NumberOfAnswers,
    
    a.Id AS AnswerId,
    
    a.Body AS AnswerBody

FROM 

    Posts q

INNER JOIN 

    Posts a ON a.ParentId = q.Id

WHERE

    q.PostTypeId = 1
    
    AND (
    
        q.Tags LIKE '%<azure-data-factory>%'
        
        OR q.Tags LIKE '%<adf>%'
        
        OR q.Title Like '%<azure data factory>%'
        
        OR q.Title Like '%<adf>%'
        
    )
    
    AND q.CreationDate >= '2018-01-01'
    
    AND q.CreationDate <= '2023-05-03'
    
ORDER BY

    q.CreationDate DESC 




I then created a Pandas dataframe within Jupyter Notebook to process and analyze the data. After applying NLP processing I created a sub-set of the data filtering by creation date and relevant keywords. 

These are the filters I applied:

# Create new column CreationDate to allow filtering
df['CreationDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
start_date = pd.to_datetime('2020-02-01')

# Filter by relevant keywords identified in previous queries
title_keywords = ['mapping', 'data flow', 'dataflow', 'flow', 'pipeline']
body_keywords = ['dataflow', 'data flow', 'flow', 'pipeline', 'following', 'mapping']
tags_keywords = ['pipeline', 'dataflow']

# Create new data frame with date and keyword filters
create_new_df = df[((df['QuestionTitle'].str.contains('|'.join(title_keywords), case=False)) |
                 (df['QuestionBody'].str.contains('|'.join(body_keywords), case=False)) |
                 (df['QuestionTags'].str.contains('|'.join(tags_keywords), case=False))) &
                 (df['CreationDate'] >= start_date)]


On this filtered data I conducted a Latent Dirichlet Allocation with three topics. Below are the respective results. List three alternative titles for each topic ordered descendingly by how relevance of the title. 

import numpy as np

import random

import gensim

from gensim import corpora

from gensim.models import LdaModel

import ast

​

# Prepare the input data by using the lemmatized tokens from the 'LemmatizedQuestionBody' column:

documents = df2['LemmatizedQuestionBody'].apply(ast.literal_eval).tolist()

​

# Set the random seed for numpy and python to ensure the same results each time the allocation re-runs

np.random.seed(42)

random.seed(42)

​

# Create a dictionary and a bag of words corpus from the documents:

dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(documents)

corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(document) for document in documents]

​

# Set the seed for the random number generator used by the LDA model to a fixed value. 

# Ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained 

# with the same input data and configuration.

random_state_seed = 42 

gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel.seed = random_state_seed

​

# Train the LDA model. You can choose the number of topics by setting the num_topics parameter:

num_topics = 3  # Change this value to the desired number of topics

lda_model1 = LdaModel(corpus, num_topics=num_topics, id2word=dictionary, passes=15) # Set the number of passes

​

# Display the top words for each topic

words_per_topic = 10  # Specify the number of top words per topic

for topic in range(num_topics):

    print(f"Topic {topic + 1}:")

    top_words = lda_model1.show_topic(topic, topn=words_per_topic)

    for word, weight in top_words:

        print(f"  {word}: {weight:.4f}")

    print()

Summarize the results of the LDA and discuss each topic individually.
ChatGPT

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a machine learning technique that is typically used to identify underlying topics in a collection of documents. The LDA that you've performed on your Azure Data Factory questions and answers from StackOverflow has yielded three distinct topics. Here are the summaries and discussions for each topic:

Topic 1: Data Management in Pipelines

This topic seems to primarily focus on the management of data within Azure Data Factory, with a particular emphasis on tables and columns. There also appears to be a significant focus on various data types and data sources. The prominence of the term "error" suggests a discussion around troubleshooting or problem-solving within this context, possibly focusing on issues that arise during data pipeline creation or management.

Topic 2: Azure Data Factory Operations

The second topic seems to center around operations in Azure Data Factory. The frequency of the terms "pipeline", "file", "activity", and "copy" suggests a focus on the practical aspects of moving and managing data within Azure Data Factory. The presence of "error" implies the topic may also involve dealing with problems or complications that arise during these operations.

Topic 3: Microsoft Azure Data Factory Overview

The third topic appears to be a more general discussion about Microsoft Azure Data Factory. The presence of terms like "microsoft", "azure", "factory", and "new" suggests a focus on broader concepts or updates about Azure Data Factory. The term "http" might indicate a discussion about web-based aspects of Azure Data Factory or perhaps how it integrates with other web services.

In summary, the LDA has identified three distinct themes in your dataset: data management within pipelines, practical operations within Azure Data Factory, and a general overview or discussion about Azure Data Factory. This gives you a good idea of the types of discussions that are happening around Azure Data Factory on StackOverflow.

Vader Sentiment Analysis is a method used to determine the sentiment of a text, which is particularly effective for social media content. It gives a compound score that calculates the sentiment of the text as a whole, and also provides scores for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments separately.

Here are the summaries and discussions for each topic based on the Vader Sentiment Analysis results:

Topic 1: Data Management in Pipelines

The sentiment analysis for this topic has a negative score of 0.0279, a neutral score of 0.9086, a positive score of 0.0634, and a compound score of 0.3110. The high neutral score indicates that the discussion is mostly factual or objective. The compound score, which considers the balance of positive and negative sentiments, is positive, suggesting an overall positive sentiment in this topic. However, the positive sentiment is not overwhelming, given the relatively low positive score.

Topic 2: Azure Data Factory Operations

The sentiment analysis for this topic has a negative score of 0.0311, a neutral score of 0.9096, a positive score of 0.0593, and a compound score of 0.2123. Similar to Topic 1, this topic also shows a high neutral score, indicating a predominance of objective or factual discussions. The compound score is also positive but less than Topic 1, indicating a more subdued overall positive sentiment.

Topic 3: Microsoft Azure Data Factory Overview

The sentiment analysis for this topic has a negative score of 0.0427, a neutral score of 0.9056, a positive score of 0.0517, and a compound score of 0.0415. This topic has a slightly higher negative sentiment compared to the other topics, but the majority of the content is still rated as neutral. The compound score is quite low, suggesting a relatively balanced mix of positive and negative sentiments, with a slight inclination towards the positive side.

In summary, all three topics are mainly neutral, reflecting objective, fact-based discussions typical of technical forums like StackOverflow. Topics 1 and 2 have a mildly positive sentiment overall, while Topic 3 is more balanced with a slight positive inclination.

    Surveys and Questionnaires: These can be used to gather feedback on the requirements from a large number of users. This could include questions about the importance and relevance of each requirement.

    Prototyping: Creating a prototype of the system or feature can be a useful way to validate requirements. Users can interact with the prototype and give feedback on whether it meets the requirements.

    User Stories and Use Cases: Develop user stories and use cases based on the requirements. These narratives describe how a user interacts with the system and helps to validate if the requirements are well understood and meet user needs.

    Requirements Review Meetings: Organize meetings with stakeholders where the proposed requirements and their categories are reviewed. Feedback and suggestions are collected during these sessions.

    Prioritization: Rank the requirements in order of importance to the users and the business. This can help to validate if the right requirements have been identified.

Remember, the goal is to ensure that the requirements are necessary, feasible, and valuable. They should be in alignment with the strategic direction of the product or service, and they should be something that the development team has the capability to deliver.
